Antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) are substances ( antibodies ) that form against mitochondria. The mitochondria are an important part of cells. They are the energy source inside the cells. These help the cells work properly. This article discusses the blood test used to measure the amount of AMA in the blood. How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed. It is most often taken from a vein. The procedure is called a venipuncture . How to Prepare for the Test Your health care provider may tell you not to eat or drink anything for up to 6 hours before the test (most often overnight). How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others may feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing. Why the Test is Performed You may need this test if you have signs of liver damage. This test is most often used to diagnose primary biliary cholangitis, formerly called primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). The test may also be used to tell the difference between bile system-related cirrhosis and liver problems due to other causes such as a blockage, viral hepatitis , or alcoholic cirrhosis. Normal Results Normally, there are no antibodies present. What Abnormal Results Mean This test is important for diagnosing PBC. Almost all people with the condition will test positive. It is rare that a person without the condition will have a positive result. However, some people with a positive test for AMA and no other sign of liver disease may progress to PBC over time. Rarely, abnormal results may also be found that are due to other kinds of liver disease and some autoimmune diseases. Risks Risks for having blood drawn are slight, but can include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Images Blood test References Daniels L, Khalili M, Goldstein E, Bluth MH, Bowne W, Pincus MR.

Alcoholic neuropathy is damage to the nerves that results from excessive drinking of alcohol. Causes The exact cause of alcoholic neuropathy is unknown. It likely includes both a direct poisoning of the nerve by the alcohol and the effect of poor nutrition associated with alcoholism. Up to half of long-term heavy alcohol users develop this condition. In severe cases, nerves that regulate internal body functions (autonomic nerves) may be involved. Symptoms Symptoms of this condition include any of the following: Numbness in the arms and legs Abnormal sensations , such as "pins and needles" Painful sensations in the arms and legs Muscle problems, including weakness , cramps , aches , or spasms Heat intolerance , especially after exercise Erection problems ( impotence ) Problems urinating , incontinence (leaking urine), feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, difficulty beginning to urinate Constipation or diarrhea Nausea, vomiting Problems swallowing or talking Unsteady gait (walking) Changes in muscle strength or sensation usually occur on both sides of the body and are more common in the legs than in the arms. Symptoms usually develop gradually and become worse over time. Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about symptoms. An eye exam may show eye problems. Excessive alcohol use often makes the body unable to use or store certain vitamins and minerals. Blood tests will be ordered to check for a deficiency (lack) of: Thiamine (vitamin B1) Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) Vitamin B12 Folic acid Other tests may be ordered to check for other possible causes of neuropathy or damage to body systems due to neuropathy. Tests may include: Electrolyte levels , including glucose to check for diabetes Electromyography (EMG) to check the health of the muscles and the nerves that control the muscles Hemoglobin A1c test to check for diabetes Liver and kidney function tests Thyroid function tests Levels of vitamins and minerals in the body Nerve conduction tests to check how fast electrical signals move through a nerve Nerve biopsy to remove a small piece of a nerve for examination Upper GI and small bowel series Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to examine the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine Voiding cystourethrogram , an x-ray study of the bladder and urethra Treatment Stopping the use of alcohol is the most important first step. People will often need counseling from alcohol use disorder specialists. If there are other medical problems that can also cause nerve damage, such as diabetes, they should be treated as well. Once the alcohol problem has been addressed, treatment goals include: Controlling symptoms Maximizing ability to function independently Preventing injury It is important to supplement the diet with vitamins, including thiamine and folic acid. Physical therapy and orthopedic appliances (such as splints) may be needed to maintain muscle function and limb position. Medicines may be needed to treat pain or uncomfortable sensations due to nerve damage. They will be prescribed the smallest dose of medicine needed to reduce symptoms. This may help prevent drug dependence and other side effects of chronic use. Positioning or the use of a bed frame that keeps the covers off the legs may help reduce pain. People with lightheadedness or dizziness when standing up (orthostatic hypotension) may need to try several different treatments before finding one that successfully reduces their symptoms. Treatments that may help include: Wearing compression stockings Eating extra salt Sleeping with the head elevated Using medicines Bladder problems may be treated with: Manual expression of urine Intermittent catheterization ( male or female ) Medicines Impotence, diarrhea, constipation, or other symptoms are treated when necessary. These symptoms often respond poorly to treatment in people with alcoholic neuropathy. It is important to protect body parts with reduced sensation from injury. This may include: Checking the temperature of bath water to prevent burns Changing footwear Frequently inspecting the feet and shoes to reduce injury caused by pressure or objects in the shoes Guarding the extremities to prevent injury from pressure Alcohol must be stopped to prevent the damage from getting worse. Treatment for alcoholism may include counseling, social support such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), or medicines. Outlook (Prognosis) Damage to nerves from alcoholic neuropathy is usually permanent. It is likely to get worse if the person continues to use alcohol or if nutritional problems are not corrected. Alcoholic neuropathy is usually not life threatening, but it can severely affect quality of life. When to Contact a Medical Professional Call for an appointment with your provider if you have symptoms of alcoholic neuropathy. Prevention The only way to prevent alcoholic neuropathy is not to drink excessive amounts of alcohol.

Some changes in the heart and blood vessels normally occur with age. However, many other changes that are common with aging are due to or worsened by modifiable factors. If not treated, these can lead to heart disease. BACKGROUND The heart has two sides. The right side pumps blood to the lungs to receive oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide. The left side pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body. Blood flows out of the heart, first through the aorta, and then through arteries, which branch out and get smaller and smaller as they go into the tissues. In the tissues, they become tiny capillaries. Capillaries are where the blood gives up (releases) oxygen and nutrients to the tissues, and receives carbon dioxide and wastes back from the tissues. Then, the vessels begin to collect together into larger and larger veins, which return blood to the heart. Watch this video about: Blood flow AGING CHANGES Heart: The heart has a natural pacemaker system that controls the heartbeat. Some of the pathways of this system may develop fibrous tissue and fat deposits. The natural pacemaker (the sinoatrial or SA node) loses some of its cells. These changes may result in a slightly slower heart rate . A slight increase in the size of the heart, especially the left ventricle occurs in some people. The heart wall thickens, so the amount of blood that the chamber can hold may actually decrease despite the increased overall heart size. The heart may fill more slowly. Heart changes often cause the electrocardiogram ( ECG ) of a normal, healthy older person to be slightly different than the ECG of a healthy younger adult. Abnormal rhythms ( arrhythmias ), such as atrial fibrillation , are more common in older people. They may be caused by several types of heart disease. Normal changes in the heart include deposits of the "aging pigment," lipofuscin . The heart muscle cells degenerate slightly. The valves inside the heart, which control the direction of blood flow, thicken and become stiffer. A heart murmur caused by valve stiffness is fairly common in older people. Blood vessels: Receptors called baroreceptors monitor the blood pressure and make changes to help maintain a fairly constant blood pressure when a person changes positions or is doing other activities. The baroreceptors become less sensitive with aging. This may explain why many older people have orthostatic hypotension, a condition in which the blood pressure falls when a person goes from lying or sitting to standing. This causes dizziness because there is less blood flow to the brain. The capillary walls thicken slightly. This may cause a slightly slower rate of exchange of nutrients and wastes. The main artery from the heart (aorta) becomes thicker, stiffer, and less flexible. This is probably related to changes in the connective tissue of the blood vessel wall. This makes the blood pressure higher and makes the heart work harder, which may lead to thickening of the heart muscle (hypertrophy). The other arteries also thicken and stiffen. In general, most older people have a moderate increase in blood pressure. Blood: The blood itself changes slightly with age. Normal aging causes a reduction in total body water. As part of this, there is less fluid in the bloodstream, so blood volume decreases. The speed with which red blood cells are produced in response to stress or illness is reduced. This creates a slower response to blood loss and anemia. Most of the white blood cells stay at the same levels, although certain white blood cells important to immunity ( neutrophils ) decrease in their number and ability to fight off bacteria. This reduces the ability to resist infection. EFFECT OF CHANGES Normally, the heart continues to pump enough blood to supply all parts of the body. However, an older heart may not be able to pump blood as well when you make it work harder. Some of the things that make your heart work harder are: Certain medicines Emotional stress Physical exertion Illness Infections Injuries COMMON PROBLEMS Angina (chest pain caused by temporarily reduced blood flow to the heart muscle), shortness of breath with exertion, and heart attack can result from coronary artery disease. Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) of various types can occur. Anemia may occur, possibly related to malnutrition, chronic infections, blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract, or as a complication of other diseases or medicines. Atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) is very common. Fatty plaque deposits inside the blood vessels cause them to narrow and may totally block blood vessels. Congestive heart failure is also very common in older people. In people older than 75, congestive heart failure occurs 10 times more often than in younger adults. Coronary artery disease is fairly common. It is usually a result of atherosclerosis. High blood pressure and orthostatic hypotension are more common with older age. Older people on blood pressure medicines need to work with their doctor to find the best way to manage their high blood pressure. This is because too much medicine may cause low blood pressure and could lead to a fall. Heart valve diseases are fairly common. Aortic stenosis , or narrowing of the aortic valve, is the most common valve disease in older adults. Transient ischemic attacks ( TIA ) or strokes can occur if blood flow to the brain is disrupted. Other problems with the heart and blood vessels include the following: Blood clots Deep vein thrombosis Thrombophlebitis Peripheral vascular disease , resulting in intermittent pain in the legs when walking (claudication) Varicose veins Aneurysms may develop in one of the major arteries from the heart or in the brain. Aneurysms are an abnormal widening or ballooning of a part of an artery due to weakness in the wall of the blood vessel. If an aneurysm bursts it may cause bleeding and death. PREVENTION You can help your circulatory system (heart and blood vessels). Heart disease risk factors that you have some control over include high blood pressure, cholesterol levels, diabetes, obesity, and smoking. Eat a heart-healthy diet with reduced amounts of saturated fat and cholesterol, and control your weight. Follow your health care provider's recommendations for treating high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes. Reduce or stop smoking. Men age 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked should be screened for aneurysms in their abdominal aorta usually with an ultrasound exam. Get more exercise: Exercise may help prevent obesity, and it helps people with diabetes control their blood sugar. Exercise may help you maintain your abilities as much as possible, and it reduces stress. Moderate exercise is one of the best things you can do to keep your heart, and the rest of your body, healthy. Consult with your provider before beginning a new exercise program. Exercise moderately and within your capabilities, but do it regularly. People who exercise often have less body fat and smoke less than people who do not exercise. They also tend to have fewer blood pressure problems and less heart disease. Have regular check-ups for your heart: Have your blood pressure checked every year. If you have diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or certain other conditions, your blood pressure may need to be monitored more closely. If your cholesterol level is normal, have it rechecked every 5 years. If you have diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or certain other conditions, your cholesterol may need to be monitored more closely.

As you age, the way your senses (hearing, vision, taste, smell, touch) give you information about the world changes. Your senses become less sharp, and this can make it harder for you to notice details. Sensory changes can affect your lifestyle. You may have problems communicating, enjoying activities, and staying involved with people. Sensory changes can lead to isolation. Your senses receive information from your environment. This information can be in the form of sound, light, smells, tastes, and touch. Sensory information is converted into nerve signals that are carried to the brain. There, the signals are turned into meaningful sensations. A certain amount of stimulation is required before you become aware of a sensation. This minimum level of sensation is called the threshold. Aging raises this threshold. You need more stimulation to be aware of the sensation. Aging can affect all of the senses, but usually hearing and vision are most affected. Devices such as glasses and hearing aids, or lifestyle changes can improve your ability to hear and see. HEARING Your ears have two jobs. One is hearing and the other is maintaining balance. Hearing occurs after sound vibrations cross the eardrum to the inner ear. The vibrations are changed into nerve signals in the inner ear and are carried to the brain by the auditory nerve. Watch this video about: Hearing and the cochlea Balance (equilibrium) is controlled in the inner ear. Fluid and small hair in the inner ear stimulate the auditory nerve. This helps the brain maintain balance. As you age, structures inside the ear start to change and their functions decline. Your ability to pick up sounds decreases. You may also have problems maintaining your balance as you sit, stand, and walk. Age-related hearing loss is called presbycusis . It affects both ears equally. Hearing, particularly the ability to hear high-frequency sounds, may decline. You may also have trouble telling the difference between certain sounds. Or, you may have problems hearing a conversation when there is background noise. If you are having trouble hearing, discuss your symptoms with your health care provider. One way to manage hearing loss is by getting fitted with hearing aids. Persistent, abnormal ear noise ( tinnitus ) is another common problem in older adults. Causes of tinnitus may include wax buildup, medicines that damage structures inside the ear or mild hearing loss. If you have tinnitus, ask your provider how to manage the condition. Impacted ear wax can also cause trouble hearing and is common with age. Your provider can remove impacted ear wax. VISION Vision occurs when light is processed by your eye and interpreted by your brain. Light passes through the transparent eye surface (cornea). It continues through the pupil, the opening to the inside of the eye. The pupil becomes larger or smaller to control the amount of light that enters the eye. The colored part of the eye is called the iris . It is a muscle that controls pupil size. After light passes through your pupil, it reaches the lens. The lens focuses light on your retina (the back of the eye). The retina converts light energy into a nerve signal that the optic nerve carries to the brain, where it is interpreted. Watch this video about: Seeing All of the eye structures change with aging. The cornea becomes less sensitive, so you might not notice eye injuries. By the time you turn 60, your pupils may decrease to about one third of the size they were when you were 20. The pupils may react more slowly in response to darkness or bright light. The lens becomes yellowed, less flexible, and slightly cloudy leading to the development of cataracts. The fat pads supporting the eyes decrease and the eyes sink into their sockets. The eye muscles become less able to fully rotate the eye. As you age, the sharpness of your vision ( visual acuity ) gradually declines. The most common problem is difficulty focusing the eyes on close-up objects. This condition is called presbyopia . Reading glasses, bifocal glasses, or contact lenses can help correct presbyopia. You may be less able to tolerate glare. For example, glare from a shiny floor in a sunlit room can make it difficult to get around indoors. You may have trouble adapting to darkness or bright light. Problems with glare, brightness, and darkness may cause problems driving at night. As you age, it gets harder to tell blues from greens than it is to tell reds from yellows. Using warm contrasting colors (yellow, orange, and red) in your home can improve your ability to see. Keeping a red light on in darkened rooms, such as the hallway or bathroom, makes it easier to see than using a regular night light. With aging, the gel-like substance (vitreous) inside your eye starts to shrink. This can create small particles called floaters in your field of vision. In most cases, floaters do not reduce your vision. But if you develop floaters suddenly or have a rapid increase in the number of floaters, you should have your eyes checked by a professional, as this may indicate a retinal detachment. Reduced peripheral vision (side vision) is common in older people. This can limit your activity and ability to interact with others. It may be hard to communicate with people sitting next to you because you cannot see them well. Driving can become dangerous. Weakened eye muscles may prevent you from moving your eyes in all directions. It may be hard to look upward. The area in which objects can be seen ( visual field ) gets smaller. Aging eyes also may not produce enough tears. This leads to dry eyes which may be uncomfortable. When dry eyes are not treated, infection, inflammation, and scarring of the cornea can occur. You can relieve dry eyes by using eye drops or artificial tears. The upper eyelids may sag because of weakened muscular support. This may lead to visual loss if the sagging is severe. Common eye disorders that cause vision changes that are NOT normal include: Cataracts -- clouding of the lens of the eye Glaucoma -- rise in fluid pressure in the eye Macular degeneration -- disease in the macula (responsible for central vision) that causes vision loss Retinopathy -- disease in the retina often caused by diabetes or high blood pressure If you are having vision problems, discuss your symptoms with your provider. TASTE AND SMELL The senses of taste and smell work together. Most tastes are linked with odors. The sense of smell begins at the nerve endings high in the lining of the nose. Watch this video about: Smelling You have about 10,000 taste buds. Your taste buds sense sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami flavors. Umami is a taste linked with foods that contain glutamate, such as the seasoning monosodium glutamate (MSG). Watch this video about: Tasting Smell and taste play a role in food enjoyment and safety. A delicious meal or pleasant aroma can improve social interaction and enjoyment of life. Smell and taste also allow you to detect danger, such as spoiled food, gases, and smoke. The number of taste buds decreases as you age. Each remaining taste bud also begins to shrink. Sensitivity to the five tastes often declines after age 60. In addition, your mouth produces less saliva as you age. This can cause dry mouth, which can affect your sense of taste. Your sense of smell can also diminish, especially after age 70. This may be related to a loss of nerve endings and less mucus production in the nose. Mucus helps odors stay in the nose long enough to be detected by the nerve endings. It also helps clear odors from the nerve endings. Certain things can speed up the loss of taste and smell. These include diseases, smoking, and exposure to harmful particles in the air. Decreased taste and smell can lessen your interest and enjoyment in eating. You may not be able to sense certain dangers if you cannot smell odors such as natural gas or smoke from a fire. If your senses of taste and smell have diminished, talk to your provider. The following may help: Switch to a different medicine, if the medicine you take is affecting your ability to smell and taste. Use different spices or change the way you prepare food. Buy safety products, such as a gas detector that sounds an alarm you can hear. TOUCH, VIBRATION, AND PAIN The sense of touch makes you aware of pain, temperature, pressure, vibration, and body position. Skin, muscles, tendons, joints, and internal organs have nerve endings (receptors) that detect these sensations. Some receptors give the brain information about the position and condition of internal organs. Though you may not be aware of this information, it helps to identify changes (for example, the pain of appendicitis ). Your brain interprets the type and amount of touch sensation. It also interprets the sensation as pleasant (such as being comfortably warm), unpleasant (such as being very hot), or neutral (such as being aware that you are touching something). Watch this video about: Feeling pain With aging, sensations may be reduced or changed. These changes can occur because of decreased blood flow to the nerve endings or to the spinal cord or brain. The spinal cord transmits nerve signals and the brain interprets these signals. Health problems, such as a lack of certain nutrients, can also cause sensation changes. Brain surgery, problems in the brain, confusion, and nerve damage from injury or long-term (chronic) diseases such as diabetes can also result in sensation changes. Symptoms of changed sensation vary based on the cause. With decreased temperature sensitivity, it can be hard to tell the difference between cool and cold and hot and warm. This can increase the risk of injury from frostbite , hypothermia (dangerously low body temperature), and burns . Reduced ability to detect vibration, touch, and pressure increases the risk of injuries, including pressure ulcers (skin sores that develop when pressure cuts off blood supply to the area). After age 50, many people have reduced sensitivity to pain. Or, you may feel and recognize pain, but it does not bother you. For example, when you are injured, you may not know how severe the injury is because the pain does not trouble you. You may develop problems walking because of reduced ability to perceive where your body is in relation to the floor. This increases your risk of falling, a common problem for older people. Older people can become more sensitive to light touches because their skin is thinner. If you have noticed changes in touch, pain, or problems standing or walking, talk with your provider. There may be ways to manage the symptoms. The following measures can help you stay safe: Lower the water heater temperature to no higher than 120°F (49°C) to avoid burns. Check the thermometer to decide how to dress, rather than waiting until you feel overheated or chilled. Inspect your skin, especially your feet, for injuries. If you find an injury, treat it. Do not assume the injury is not serious because the area is not painful.

When your child is diagnosed with cancer, one of the hardest things you have to do is to explain what it means to have cancer. Know that what you tell your child will help your child face cancer. Explaining things honestly at the right level for your child's age will help your child be less afraid. Children understand things differently based on their age. Knowing what your child may understand, and what questions they may ask, can help you know better what to say. What can my Child Understand? Each child is different. Some children understand more than others. Your day-to-day approach will depend on your child's age and maturity. Here is a general guide. CHILDREN AGES 0 to 2 YEARS Children this age: Only understand things that they can sense by touch and sight Do not understand cancer Focus on what is happening in the moment Are afraid of medical tests and pain Are afraid of being away from their parents How to talk to children ages 0 to 2 years: Talk to your child about what is happening in the moment or that day. Explain procedures and tests before you arrive. For example, let your child know that the needle will hurt for a bit, and it is OK to cry. Give your child choices, such as fun ways to take medicine, new books or videos during treatments, or mixing medicines with different juices. Let your child know you will always be by their side at the hospital. Explain how long they will be in the hospital and when they will be going home. CHILDREN AGES 2 to 7 YEARS Children this age: May understand cancer when you explain using simple words. Look for cause and effect. They may blame the illness on a specific event, such as not finishing dinner. Are afraid of being away from their parents. May be afraid that that they will have to live in the hospital. Are afraid of medical tests and pain. How to talk to children ages 2 to 7 years: Use simple terms like "good cells" and "bad cells" to explain the cancer. You can say it is a contest between the two types of cells. Tell your child that they need treatment so that the hurting will go away and the good cells can get stronger. Make sure your child knows that nothing they did caused the cancer. Explain procedures and tests before you arrive. Let your child know what will happen, and it is OK to be scared or cry. Assure your child that health care providers have ways to make tests less painful. Make sure you or your child's health care team offers choices and rewards. Let your child know you will be by their side at the hospital and when they go home. CHILDREN AGES 7 to 12 YEARS Children this age: Understand cancer in a basic sense Think of their illness as symptoms and what they are not able to do compared to other kids Understand that getting better comes from taking medicines and doing what providers say Are not likely to blame their illness on something they did Are afraid of pain and being hurt Will hear information about cancer from outside sources like school, TV, and the Internet How to talk to children ages 7 to 12 years: Explain cancer cells as "troublemaker" cells. Tell your child that the body has different types of cells that need to do different jobs in the body. The cancer cells get in the way of the good cells and treatments help to get rid of the cancer cells. Explain procedures and tests before you arrive and that it is OK to be nervous or sick of it. Ask your child to let you know about things they have heard about cancer from other sources or any worries they have. Make sure the information they have is accurate. CHILDREN AGES 12 YEARS AND OLDER Children this age: Can understand complex concepts Can imagine things that have not happened to them May have many questions about their illness Think of their illness as symptoms and what they miss or are not able to do compared to other kids Understand that getting better comes from taking medicines and doing what providers say May want to help make decisions May be more concerned about physical side effects such as hair loss or weight gain Will hear information about cancer from outside sources like school, TV, and the Internet How to talk to children ages 12 years and older: Explain cancer as a disease when some cells go wild and grow too quickly. The cancer cells get in the way of how the body needs to work. Treatments will kill the cancer cells so the body can work well and symptoms will go away. Be honest about procedures, tests, and side effects. Talk openly with your teen about treatment options, concerns, and fears. For older children, there may be online programs that can help them learn about their cancer and ways to cope. Other Tips for Talking With Your Child About Cancer? Other ways to talk to your child about cancer: Practice what you will say before you bring up new topics with your child. Ask your child's provider for advice on how to explain things. Have another family member or a provider with you when talking about cancer and the treatments. Check in with your child often about how your child is coping. Be honest. Share your feelings and ask your child to share their feelings. Explain medical terms in ways your child can understand. While the road ahead may not be easy, remind your child that most children with cancer are cured. References American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) website.

Current guidelines recommend that people with coronary artery disease (CAD) receive antiplatelet therapy with either aspirin or clopidogrel . Aspirin therapy is very helpful for people with CAD or a history of stroke. If you have been diagnosed with CAD, your health care provider may recommend that you take a daily dose (from 75 to 162 mg) of aspirin. A daily dose of 81 mg is recommended for people who have had angioplasty (also called PCI). It is most often prescribed along with another antiplatelet medicine. Aspirin can reduce the risk for heart attack and ischemic stroke. However, using aspirin over the long-term can raise your risk for stomach bleeding. Daily aspirin should not be used for prevention in healthy people who are at low risk for heart disease. You provider will consider your overall medical condition and risk factors for heart attack before recommending aspirin therapy. How Aspirin Helps you Taking aspirin helps prevent blood clots from forming in your arteries and may help lower your risk for a stroke or heart attack . Your provider may recommend to take daily aspirin if: You do not have a history of heart disease or stroke, but you are at high risk for a heart attack or stroke. (These recommendations sometimes change as new information becomes available.) You have been diagnosed with heart disease or stroke already. Aspirin helps get more blood flowing to your legs. It can treat a heart attack and prevent blood clots when you have an abnormal heartbeat. You probably will take aspirin after you have treatment for clogged arteries. You will most likely take aspirin as a pill. A daily low-dose aspirin (75 to 81 mg) is most often the first choice for preventing heart disease or stroke. Talk to your provider before taking aspirin every day. Your provider may change your dose from time to time. Side Effects Aspirin can have side effects such as: Diarrhea Itching Nausea Skin rash Stomach pain Before you start taking aspirin, tell your provider if you have bleeding problems or stomach ulcers. Also say if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. Taking Aspirin Take your aspirin with food and water. This can reduce side effects. You may need to stop taking this medicine before surgery or dental work. Always talk to your provider before you stop taking this medicine. If you have had a heart attack or a stent placed, be sure to ask your heart doctor if it is OK to stop taking aspirin. You may need medicine for other health problems. Ask your provider if this is safe. If you miss a dose of your aspirin, take it as soon as possible. If it is time for your next dose, take your usual amount. Do not take extra pills. Store your medicines in a cool, dry place. Keep them away from children. When to Call the Doctor Contact your provider if you have side effects. Side effects can be any signs of unusual bleeding: Blood in the urine or stools Nosebleeds Unusual bruising Heavy bleeding from cuts Black tarry stools Coughing up blood Unusually heavy menstrual bleeding or unexpected vaginal bleeding Vomit that looks like coffee grounds Other side effects can be dizziness or difficulty swallowing. Contact your provider if you have wheezing, breathing difficulty, or tightness or pain in your chest. Side effects include swelling in your face or hands. Call your provider if you have itching, hives, or tingling in your face or hands, very bad stomach pain, or a skin rash.

Anal cancer is cancer that starts in the anus. The anus is the opening at the end of your rectum. The rectum is the last part of your large intestine where solid waste from food (stool) is stored. Stool leaves your body through the anus when you have a bowel movement. Anal cancer is fairly rare. It spreads slowly and is easy to treat before it spreads. Causes Anal cancer can start anywhere in the anus. Where it starts determines the kind of cancer it is. Squamous cell carcinoma. This is the most common type of anal cancer. It starts in cells that line the anal canal and grows into the deeper tissue. Cloacogenic carcinoma. Almost all the rest of anal cancers are tumors that start in cells lining the area between the anus and rectum. Cloacogenic carcinoma looks different than squamous cell cancers, but behaves similarly and is treated the same. Adenocarcinoma. This type of anal cancer is rare in the United States. It starts in the anal glands below the anal surface and is often more advanced when it is found. Skin cancer. Some cancers form outside the anus in the perianal area. This area is mainly skin. The tumors here are skin cancers and are treated as skin cancer. The cause of anal cancer is unclear. However, there is a link between anal cancer and the human papillomavirus or HPV infection. HPV is a sexually transmitted virus that has been linked to other cancers as well. Other major risk factors include: HIV/AIDS infection. Anal cancer is more common among HIV/AIDS positive men who have sex with other men. Sexual activity. Having many sexual partners and having anal sex are both major risks. This may be due to the increased risk for HPV and HIV/AIDS infection. Smoking. Quitting will reduce your risk for anal cancer. Weak immune system. HIV/AIDS, organ transplants, certain medicines, and other conditions that weaken the immune system increase your risk. Age. Most people who have anal cancer are age 50 or older. In rare cases, it is seen in people younger than age 35. Sex and race. Anal cancer is more common among women than men in most groups. More African American males get anal cancer than females. Symptoms Rectal bleeding, often minor, is one of the first signs of anal cancer. Often, a person mistakenly thinks the bleeding is caused by hemorrhoids . Other early signs and symptoms include: A lump in or near the anus Anal pain Itching Discharge from the anus Change in bowel habits Swollen lymph nodes in the groin or anal region Exams and Tests Anal cancer is often found by an anorectal examination (DARE) during a routine physical exam. Your health care provider will ask about your health history, including sexual history, past illnesses, and your health habits. Your answers can help your provider understand your risk factors for anal cancer. Your provider may ask for other tests. They might include: Anoscopy Proctoscopy Ultrasound Biopsy If any tests show you have cancer, your provider will likely do more testing to "stage" the cancer. Staging helps show how much cancer is in your body and whether it has spread. The stage of the cancer will determine how it is treated. Treatment Treatment for anal cancer is based on: The stage of the cancer Where the tumor is located Whether the cancer has resisted initial treatment or has come back after initial treatment In most cases, anal cancer that hasn't spread can be treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy together. The combination of radiation and chemotherapy achieves better tumor control than the use of radiation alone. For very small tumors, surgery alone is typically used, instead of radiation and chemotherapy. If cancer remains after the radiation and chemotherapy, surgery is often required. This may involve removing the anus, the rectum, and part of the colon. The new end of the large intestine will then be attached to an opening (stoma) in the abdomen. This procedure is called a colostomy . Stools moving through the intestine drain through the stoma into a bag attached to the abdomen. Support Groups Cancer affects how you feel about yourself and your life. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group . Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you feel less alone. You can ask your provider or the staff at the cancer treatment center to refer you to a cancer support group. Outlook (Prognosis) Anal cancer spreads slowly. With early treatment, most people with anal cancer are cancer-free after 5 years. Possible Complications You may have side effects from surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. When to Contact a Medical Professional See your provider if you notice any of the possible symptoms of anal cancer, especially if you have any of the risk factors for it. Prevention Since the cause of anal cancer is unknown, it's not possible to completely prevent it. But you can take steps to lower your risk. Practice safer sex to help prevent HPV and HIV/AIDS infections. People who have sex with many partners or have unprotected anal sex are at high risk of developing these infections. Using condoms can offer some protection, but not total protection. Talk with your provider about your options. Ask your provider about the HPV vaccine and if you should get it. Do not smoke. If you do smoke, quitting can lower your risk for anal cancer as well as other diseases. All adults with HIV should have the following screening test for anal cancer: DARE and assessment for symptoms of for anal cancer at least once per year People under the age of 35 who have symptoms or signs of anal cancer during DARE should undergo standard anoscopy . Adults with HIV should have other tests along with high resolution anoscopy (HRA), rather than standard anoscopy, if they are: Men who have sex with men who are age 35 and older Transgender women who are age 35 and older All other people with HIV ages 45 and older If HRA is not available, people with HIV should continue to be screened using an assessment of symptoms and DARE. People with any symptoms or signs of anal cancer should have standard anoscopy, without the collection of anal specimens for diagnosis.

Atopic dermatitis is a long-term (chronic) skin disorder that causes scaly and itchy rashes. It's also called eczema. The condition is due to a hypersensitive skin reaction that is similar to an allergy. It may also be caused by defects in certain proteins in the surface of the skin. This leads to ongoing inflammation of the skin. Atopic dermatitis is most common in infants and children. It may start as early as age 2 to 6 months. Many children outgrow it by early adulthood. This condition can be difficult to control in children, so it's important to work closely with your child's health care provider. Daily skin care is important to help prevent flare-ups and keep the skin from being inflamed. Help for Itching and Scratching Severe itching is common. Itching may start even before the rash appears. Atopic dermatitis is often called the "itch that rashes" because the itching starts, and then the skin rash follows, sometimes partly as a result of scratching. To help your child avoid scratching: Use a moisturizer, topical steroid cream, barrier repair cream, or other medicine the child's provider prescribes. Keep your child's fingernails cut short. Have them wear light gloves while sleeping if scratching at night is a problem. Give antihistamines or other medicines by mouth as prescribed by your child's provider. As much as possible, teach older children not to scratch itchy skin. Day-to-Day Skin Care Daily skin care with allergen-free products may cut down on the need for medicines. Use moisturizing ointments (such as petroleum jelly), creams, or lotions. Choose skin products that are made for people with eczema or sensitive skin. These products do not contain alcohol, scents, dyes, and other chemicals. Having a humidifier to keep air moist will also help. Moisturizers and emollients work best when they are applied to skin that is wet or damp. After washing or bathing, pat the skin dry and then apply the moisturizer right away. Your provider may also recommend placing a dressing over these skin moisturizing ointments. When washing or bathing your child: Bathe less often and keep water contact as brief as possible. Short, cooler baths are better than long, hot baths. Use gentle skin care cleansers rather than traditional soaps, and use them only on your child's face, underarms, genital areas, hands, and feet. Do not scrub or dry the skin too hard or for too long. Right after bathing, apply lubricating cream, lotion, or ointment while skin is still damp to trap moisture. Dress your child in soft, comfortable clothing, such as cotton clothes. Have your child drink plenty of water. This may help add moisture to the skin. Teach older children these same tips for skin care. The rash itself, as well as the scratching, often causes breaks in the skin and may lead to infection. Keep an eye out for redness, warmth, swelling, or other signs of infection. Call your child's provider at the first sign of infection. Avoid Triggers The following triggers can make atopic dermatitis symptoms worse: Allergies to pollen, mold, dust mites, or animals Cold and dry air in the winter Colds or the flu Contact with irritants and chemicals Contact with rough materials, such as wool Dry skin Emotional stress Getting too hot or too cold, as well as sudden changes of temperature Perfumes or dyes added to skin lotions or soaps Taking frequent baths or showers and swimming often, which can dry out skin To prevent flare-ups, try to avoid: Foods, such as eggs, that may cause an allergic reaction in a very young child. Always discuss with your provider first. Wool, lanolin, and other scratchy fabrics. Use smooth, textured clothing and bedding, such as cotton. Sweating. Be careful not to over dress your child during warmer weather. Strong soaps or detergents, as well as chemicals and solvents. Sudden changes in body temperature, which may cause sweating and worsen your child's condition. Stress. Watch for signs that your child feels frustrated or stressed and teach them ways to reduce stress such as taking deep breaths or thinking about things they enjoy. Triggers that cause allergy symptoms. Do what you can to keep your home free of allergy triggers such as mold, dust, and pet dander. Skin care products that contain alcohol. Using moisturizers, creams, or ointments every day as directed may help prevent flares. Medicines From the Doctor Antihistamines taken by mouth may help if allergies cause your child's itchy skin. These medicines are often available over the counter and do not require a prescription. Ask your child's provider what kind is right for your child. Atopic dermatitis is usually treated with medicines placed directly on the skin or scalp. These are called topical medicines: The provider will probably prescribe a mild steroid cream or ointment at first, such as hydrocortisone. Topical steroids contain a hormone that helps "calm" your child's skin when it is swollen or inflamed. Your child may need a stronger medicine if this does not work. Medicines that regulate the immune system of the skin called topical immunomodulators may also be recommended. Moisturizers and creams containing ceramides that restore the barrier of the skin are also helpful. Other treatments that may be used include: Antibiotic creams or pills if your child's skin is infected. Medicines that suppress the immune system to decrease inflammation. Phototherapy, a treatment in which your child's skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light. Short-term use of systemic steroids (steroids given by mouth or through a vein as an injection). A biologic injection called dupilumab (Dupixent) may be used for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Your child's provider will tell you how much of these medicines to use and how often. Do not use more medicine or use it more often than the provider says. When to Call the Doctor Contact your child's provider if: Atopic dermatitis does not get better with home care Symptoms get worse or treatment does not work Your child has signs of infection, such as redness, pus or fluid-filled bumps on skin, fever, or pain Alternative Names Infantile eczema; Dermatitis - atopic children; Eczema - atopic - children References Eichenfield LF, Tom WL, Berger TG, et al.

Alport syndrome is a rare inherited disorder that damages the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys. It can also cause hearing loss and eye problems. Causes Alport syndrome is an inherited form of kidney inflammation (nephritis). It is caused by a defect (mutation) in a gene for a protein in the connective tissue, called collagen. The disorder is rare. There are three genetic types: X-linked Alport syndrome (XLAS) -- This is the most common type. The disease is more severe in males than in females. Autosomal recessive Alport syndrome (ARAS) -- Males and females have equally severe disease. Autosomal dominant Alport syndrome (ADAS) -- This is the rarest type. Males and females have equally severe disease. With all types of Alport syndrome, the kidneys are affected. The tiny blood vessels in the glomeruli of the kidneys are damaged. The glomeruli filter blood to make urine and remove waste products from the blood. At first, there are no symptoms. Over time, as the glomeruli are more and more damaged, kidney function is lost and waste products and fluids build up in the body. The condition can progress to end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) at an early age, between adolescence and age 40. At this point, dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed. Symptoms The main symptom of Alport syndrome is blood in the urine that is often not visible and only detected under a microscope. This occurs from a young age. As the disease progresses, other symptoms may appear. KIDNEYS Other symptoms of kidney problems include: Abnormal urine color Blood in the urine that is visible during a cold or flu or exercise Flank pain High blood pressure Swelling throughout the body (edema) Fatigue Poor appetite Excessive thirst EARS Over time, Alport syndrome also leads to hearing loss in both ears. By the early teens, it is common in males with XLAS, though in females, hearing loss is not as common and happens when they're adults. With ARAS, boys and girls have hearing loss during childhood. With ADAS, it occurs later in life. Hearing loss usually occurs before kidney failure. EYES Alport syndrome also leads to eye problems in those with XLAS and ARAS, including: Abnormal shape of the lens (anterior lenticonus), which can lead to a slow decline in vision as well as cataracts . Corneal erosion in which there is damage to the outer layer of the covering of the eyeball, leading to pain, itching, redness of the eye, or blurred vision. Abnormal coloring of the retina , a condition called dot-and-fleck retinopathy. It doesn't cause vision problems, but can help diagnose Alport syndrome. Macular hole in which there is thinning or a break in the macula. The macula is a part of the retina that makes central vision sharper and more detailed. A macular hole causes blurred or distorted central vision. Eye problems are uncommon in people with ADAS. Exams and Tests The health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms. The following tests may be done: BUN and serum creatinine Complete blood count Renal biopsy Urinalysis If your provider suspects you have Alport syndrome, you will also likely have vision and hearing tests. Treatment The goals of treatment include monitoring and controlling the disease and treating the symptoms. Your provider may recommend any of the following: A diet that limits salt, fluids, and potassium Medicines to control high blood pressure Kidney disease is managed by: Taking medicines to slow kidney damage A diet that limits salt, fluids, and protein Hearing loss can be managed with hearing aids. Eye problems are treated as needed. For example, an abnormal lens due to lenticonus or cataracts can be replaced. Genetic counseling may be recommended because the disorder is inherited. Support Groups More information and support for people with Alport syndrome and their families can be found at: Alport Syndrome Foundation -- alportsyndrome.org/for-patients/patient-resources/ National Kidney Foundation -- www.kidney.org/atoz/content/alport National Organization for Rare Disorders -- rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/alport-syndrome Outlook (Prognosis) The outlook depends on the type of Alport syndrome, biological sex, and age. For both males and females, kidney function will worsen over time. In males with XLAS, this may lead to kidney failure at an earlier age. Most men with XLAS will experience kidney failure by age 60. Women with XLAS may or may not have kidney problems, but the risk increases with age. Both males and females with ARAS will develop kidney failure by early adulthood. ADAS progresses slowly in both males and females, and kidney failure may not occur until later in life. As kidneys fail, dialysis or a kidney transplant will be needed. Kidney transplant is often very successful in people with Alport syndrome. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider for an appointment if: You have symptoms of Alport syndrome. You have a family history of Alport syndrome and you are planning to get pregnant. Your urine output decreases or stops or you see blood in your urine (this may be a symptom of chronic kidney disease). Prevention Awareness of risk factors, such as a family history of the disorder, may allow the condition to be detected early.

Avian influenza A viruses cause the influenza ( flu ) infection in birds. These viruses occur in wild birds and can infect domestic poultry. The viruses that cause the disease in birds can change (mutate) so it can spread to other animals and humans. As of May 2024, H5N1 bird flu has spread to poultry and dairy cows in the United States and has infected some poultry and dairy workers. Causes The first avian influenza in humans was reported in Hong Kong in 1997. It was called avian influenza (H5N1). The outbreak was linked to chickens. Since then, there have been human cases of avian influenza A in Asia, Africa, Europe, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Pacific, and the Near East. The virus has caused illness and even death in humans. While rare, avian influenza has also spread to humans in the United States. The latest outbreak in the United States started in 2022 and has affected over 1,100 flocks of birds in 48 states. In March 2024, the virus was detected for the first time in dairy cows. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports at least 13 states where H5N1 bird flu has infected dairy cows. Eleven people have tested positive for H5N1 in the United States since 2022. In 2022, a poultry worker tested positive for the virus and has recovered. As of May 2024, 10 poultry and dairy workers have tested positive for H5N1. Symptoms have been minor and have included a cough without a fever and conjunctivitis (eye infection). Currently, the risk for infection in people is low. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to monitor the situation. Your risk of getting the bird flu virus is higher if: You work with poultry or cattle (such as farmers or farm workers). You travel to countries where the virus is present. You are exposed to sick or dead animals infected with the virus. You are exposed to animal feces, litter, or other material contaminated by animals infected with H5N1. You eat raw or undercooked poultry meat, eggs, or unpasteurized (raw) milk or cheese from animals infected with H5N1. No one has gotten avian flu virus from eating properly cooked animals or animal products. Health care workers and people who live in the same house as people with bird flu may also be at higher risk for infection. Avian flu viruses can live in the environment for long periods of time. Infection may be spread just by touching surfaces that have the virus on them. Birds who were infected with the flu can shed the virus in their feces and saliva for as long as 10 days. Symptoms Symptoms of avian flu infection in humans depend on the strain of virus. The avian influenza virus in humans causes typical flu-like symptoms, such as: Cough Diarrhea Trouble breathing Fever greater than 100.4°F (38°C) Headache General ill feeling (malaise) Muscle aches Runny nose Sore throat Exams and Tests If you think you have been exposed to the virus, notify your health care provider before your office visit. This will give the staff a chance to take steps to protect themselves and other people during your office visit. There are tests for the avian flu, but they are not widely available. One type of test can give results in about 4 hours. Your provider might also do the following tests: Listening to the lungs (to detect abnormal breath sounds) Chest x-ray Culture from the nose or throat A method or technique to detect the virus, called RT-PCR White blood cell count Other tests may be done to look at how well your heart, kidneys, and liver are working. Treatment Treatment varies, and is based on your symptoms. Treatment with the antiviral medicine oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza) may make the disease less severe. For the medicine to work, you need to start taking it within 48 hours after your symptoms start. Oseltamivir may also be prescribed for people who live in the same house as people with avian flu. This may prevent them from getting the illness. The virus that causes human avian flu is resistant to the antiviral medicines amantadine and rimantadine. These medicines should not be used in the case of an H5N1 infection. People with severe infection may need to be hospitalized and, sometimes, placed on a breathing machine. People infected with the virus also should be kept separate from non-infected people. Providers recommend that people get an influenza (flu) shot. This may cut down the chance that the avian flu virus will mix with a human flu virus. This might create a new virus that may easily spread. Outlook (Prognosis) The outlook depends on the type of avian flu virus and how bad the infection is. The disease can be fatal. Possible Complications Complications may include: Acute respiratory failure Organ failure Pneumonia Sepsis When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you develop flu-like symptoms within 10 days of handling infected birds, being around infected cattle, or being in an area with a known avian flu outbreak. Prevention There is an approved vaccine to protect humans from the H5N1 avian flu virus. This vaccine could be used if the current H5N1 virus starts spreading among people. The US government keeps a stockpile of vaccine. At this time, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend against travel to countries affected by avian influenza. The CDC makes the following recommendations. As a general precaution: Avoid wild birds and watch them only from a distance. Avoid touching sick animals and surfaces that may be covered in their feces. Use protective clothing and special breathing masks if you work with birds or dairy cows, if you go into buildings with sick or dead animals, feces, or litter from infected animals. If you have had contact with infected animals, watch for signs of infection. If you do become infected, tell your provider. Avoid undercooked or uncooked meat. Avoid unpasteurized (raw) milk and cheeses. This reduces the risk for exposure to avian flu and other foodborne diseases. If traveling to other countries: Avoid visits to live-bird markets and poultry farms. Avoid preparing or eating undercooked poultry products. See your provider if you become sick after you return from your trip.

Ligaments are strong, flexible tissues that attach your bones to one another. They keep your joints stable and help them move in the right ways. An ankle sprain occurs when the ligaments in your ankle are stretched or torn. More about Your Injury There are 3 grades of ankle sprains: Grade I sprains : Your ligaments are stretched, and there may be slight or microscopic tearing of the ligament tissues. It is a mild injury that can improve with some light stretching. Grade II sprains : Your ligaments are partially torn. You may need to wear a splint or other immobilization device. Grade III sprains : Your ligaments are fully torn. You will likely need to wear a brace, splint, or cast for several weeks, and you may need surgery for this severe injury, especially for younger or more active persons. The last 2 kinds of sprains are often associated with tearing of small blood vessels. This allows blood to leak into tissues and cause black and blue color (as with bruising) in the area. The blood may not appear for several days. Most of the time, it is absorbed from the tissues within 2 weeks. If your sprain is more severe: You may feel strong pain and have a lot of swelling. You may not be able to walk, or walking may be painful. Some ankle sprains may become chronic (long-lasting). If this happens to you, your ankle may continue to be: Painful and swollen Weak or giving way easily What to Expect Your health care provider may order an x-ray to look for a bone fracture, or an MRI scan to look for an injury to the ligament. To help your ankle heal, your provider may treat you with a brace, a cast, or a splint, and may give you crutches to walk on. You may be asked to place only part or none of your weight on the bad ankle. You will also need to do physical therapy or exercises to help you recover from the injury. Self-care You can decrease swelling by: Resting and not putting weight on your foot Elevating your foot on a pillow at or above the level of your heart Apply ice every hour while you are awake, 20 minutes at a time and covered by a towel or bag, for the first 24 hours after the injury. After the first 24 hours, apply ice 20 minutes 3 to 4 times per day. Do not apply ice directly to your skin. You should wait at least 30 minutes in between ice applications. Pain medicines, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, may help to ease pain and swelling. You can buy these medicines without a prescription. Talk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, liver disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past. Do not take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or more than your provider advises you to take. Carefully read the warnings on the label before taking any medicine. After your injury you may take acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) if your provider tells you it is safe to do so. People with liver disease should not take this medicine. Getting Active The pain and swelling of an ankle sprain most often gets better within 48 hours. After that, you can begin to put weight back on your injured foot. Put only as much weight on your foot as is comfortable at first. Slowly work your way up to your full weight. If your ankle begins to hurt, stop and rest. Your provider will give you exercises to strengthen your foot and ankle. Doing these exercises can help prevent future sprains and chronic ankle pain. For less severe sprains, you may be able to go back to your normal activities after a few days. For more severe sprains, it may take several weeks. Talk to your provider before returning to more intense sports or work activities. When to Call the Doctor You should contact your provider if you notice any of the following: You cannot walk, or walking is very painful. The pain does not get better after ice, rest, and pain medicine. Your ankle does not feel any better after 5 to 7 days. Your ankle continues to feel weak or gives away easily. Your ankle is increasingly discolored (red or black and blue), or it becomes numb or tingly, feels cold, or has changes in sensation.

ACL reconstruction is surgery to reconstruct the ligament in the center of your knee. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) connects your shin bone (tibia) to your thigh bone (femur). A tear of this ligament can cause your knee to give way during physical activity, most often during side-step or crossover movements. Description Most people have general anesthesia right before surgery. This means you will be asleep and pain-free. Other kinds of anesthesia, like regional anesthesia or a block, may also be used for this surgery. The tissue to replace your damaged ACL will come from your own body or from a donor. A donor is a person who has died and chose to give all or part of their body to help others. Tissue taken from your own body is called an autograft. The most common places to take tissue from are the knee cap tendon, quadriceps tendon, or hamstring tendon. Your hamstrings are the muscles behind your knee. Tissue taken from a donor is called an allograft or cadaver graft. The procedure is usually performed with the help of knee arthroscopy . With arthroscopy, a tiny camera is inserted into the knee through a small surgical cut. The camera is connected to a video monitor in the operating room. Your surgeon will use the camera to check the ligaments and other tissues of your knee. Your surgeon will make other small cuts around your knee and insert other medical instruments. Your surgeon will fix any other damage found, and then will replace your ACL by following these steps: The torn ligament will be removed with a shaver or other instruments. If your own tissue is being used to make your new ACL, your surgeon will make a larger cut. Then, the autograft will be removed through this cut. Your surgeon will make tunnels and sockets in your bone through which to bring the new tissue. This new tissue will be put at the same place as your old ACL. Your surgeon will attach the new ligament to the bone with screws or other devices to hold it in place. As it heals, the graft will remodel to become your new ligament. At the end of the surgery, your surgeon will close your cuts with sutures (stitches) and cover the area with a dressing. You may be able to view pictures after the procedure of what the surgeon saw and what was done during the surgery. Why the Procedure is Performed If you do not have your ACL reconstructed, your knee may continue to be unstable. This increases the chance you may have a meniscus tear. ACL reconstruction may be used for these knee problems: Knee that gives way or feels unstable during daily activities Knee pain Inability to return to sports or other activities When other ligaments are also injured When your meniscus is torn Before surgery, talk to your health care provider about the time and effort you will need to recover. You will need to follow a rehabilitation program for 4 to 6 months. Your ability to return to full activity will depend on how well you follow the program. Risks The risks from any anesthesia are: Allergic reactions to medicines Breathing problems The risks from any surgery are: Bleeding Infection Other risks from this surgery may include: Blood clot in the leg Failure of the ligament to heal Failure of the surgery to relieve symptoms Injury to a nearby blood vessel Pain in the knee Stiffness of the knee or lost range of motion Weakness of the knee Before the Procedure Always tell your provider what medicines you are taking, even medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription. During the 2 weeks before your surgery: You may be asked to stop taking medicines that make it harder for your blood to clot. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve), and other medicines. Ask your provider which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery. If you have diabetes , heart disease, or other medical conditions, your surgeon will ask you to see the provider who treats you for these conditions. Tell your provider if you have been drinking a lot of alcohol, more than 1 drink per day for women or 2 drinks per day for men. If you smoke, try to stop. Smoking can slow down wound and bone healing. Ask your providers for help if you need it. Always let your provider know about any cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illnesses you may have before your surgery. On the day of your surgery: You will often be asked not to drink or eat anything for 6 to 12 hours before the procedure. Take the medicines you have been told to take with a small sip of water. You will be told when to arrive at the hospital. After the Procedure Most people can go home the day of the surgery. You may have to wear a knee brace for the first 1 to 6 weeks. You also may need crutches for 1 to 6 weeks. How long you will need to use a crutch and brace will depend on the type of surgery you had and the extent of the reconstruction. Most people are allowed to move their knee right after surgery. This may help prevent stiffness. You may need medicine for your pain. Physical therapy can help many people regain motion and strength in their knee. Therapy can last up to 4 to 6 months. How soon you return to work will depend on the kind of work you do. It can be from a few days to a few months. A full return to activities and sports will often take 4 to 6 months. Sports that involve quick changes in direction, such as soccer, basketball, and football, may require up to 9 to 12 months of rehabilitation. Outlook (Prognosis) Most people will have a stable knee that does not give way after ACL reconstruction. Better surgical methods and rehabilitation have led to: Less pain and stiffness after surgery Fewer complications with the surgery itself Faster recovery time Alternative Names Anterior cruciate ligament repair; Knee surgery - ACL; Knee arthroscopy - ACL Patient Instructions ACL reconstruction - discharge Getting your home ready - knee or hip surgery Surgical wound care - open References Brotzman SB.

Aortic dissection is a serious condition in which there is a tear in the wall of the major artery carrying blood out of the heart (aorta). As the tear extends along the wall of the aorta, blood can flow in between the layers of the blood vessel wall (dissection). This can lead to aortic rupture or decreased blood flow (ischemia) to organs. Causes When it leaves the heart, the aorta first moves up through the chest towards the head (the ascending aorta). It then bends or arches, and finally moves down through the chest and abdomen (the descending aorta). Aortic dissection most often happens because of a tear or damage to the inner wall of the aorta. This very often occurs in the chest (thoracic) part of the artery, but it may also occur in the abdominal aorta. When a tear occurs, it creates 2 channels: One in which blood continues to travel Another where blood stays still If the channel with non-traveling blood gets bigger, it can push on other branches of the aorta. This can narrow the other branches and reduce blood flow through them. An aortic dissection may also cause abnormal widening or ballooning of the aorta ( aneurysm ). The exact cause is unknown, but more common risks include: Aging Atherosclerosis Blunt trauma to the chest, such as hitting the steering wheel of a car during an accident High blood pressure Other risk factors and conditions linked to aortic dissection include: Bicuspid aortic valve Coarctation (narrowing) of the aorta Connective tissue disorders (such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) and rare genetic disorders Heart surgery or procedures Pregnancy Swelling of the blood vessels due to conditions such as arteritis and syphilis Aortic dissection occurs in about 2 out of every 10,000 people. It can affect anyone, but is most often seen in men ages 40 to 70. Symptoms In most cases, the symptoms begin suddenly, and include severe chest pain . The pain may feel like a heart attack. Pain can be described as sharp, stabbing, tearing, or ripping. It is felt below the breast bone, and then moves under the shoulder blades or to the back. Pain can move to the shoulder, neck, arm, jaw, abdomen, or hips. The pain changes position, often moving to the arms and legs as the aortic dissection gets worse. Symptoms are caused by a decrease of blood flowing to the rest of the body, and can include: Anxiety and a feeling of doom Fainting or dizziness Heavy sweating (clammy skin) Nausea and vomiting Pale skin ( pallor ) Rapid, weak pulse Shortness of breath and trouble breathing when lying flat ( orthopnea ) Other symptoms may include: Pain in the abdomen Stroke symptoms Swallowing difficulties from pressure on the esophagus Exams and Tests The health care provider will take your medical and family medical history and listen to your heart, lungs, and abdomen with a stethoscope. The exam may find: A "blowing" murmur over the aorta, heart murmur, or other abnormal sound A difference in blood pressure between the right and left arms, or between the arms and legs Low blood pressure Signs resembling a heart attack Signs of shock , but with normal blood pressure Aortic dissection or aortic aneurysm may be seen on: Aortic angiography Chest x-ray Chest MRI CT scan of chest with dye Duplex Doppler ultrasonography (occasionally performed) Echocardiogram Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) Blood work to rule out a heart attack is needed. Treatment Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition and needs to be treated right away. Dissections that occur in the part of the aorta that is leaving the heart (ascending) are treated with surgery. Dissections that occur in other parts of the aorta (descending) may be managed with surgery or medicines. Two techniques may be used for surgery: Standard, open surgery. This requires a surgical incision that is made in the chest or abdomen. Endovascular aortic repair. This surgery is done without any major surgical incisions. Medicines that lower blood pressure may be prescribed. These medicines may be given through a vein (intravenously). Beta-blockers are the medicines of first choice. Strong pain relievers are very often needed. If the aortic valve is damaged, valve replacement is needed. If the heart arteries are involved, a coronary bypass is also performed. Outlook (Prognosis) Aortic dissection is life threatening. The condition can be managed with surgery if it is done before the aorta ruptures. Less than one half of people with a ruptured aorta survive. Those who survive will need lifelong, aggressive treatment of high blood pressure. They will need to be followed up with CT scans every few months to monitor the aorta. Possible Complications Aortic dissection may decrease or stop the blood flow to many different parts of the body. This may result in short-term or long-term problems, or damage to the: Brain Heart Intestines or bowels Kidneys Legs When to Contact a Medical Professional If you have symptoms of an aortic dissection or severe chest pain, call 911 or the local emergency number, or go to the emergency room as quickly as possible. Prevention Many cases of aortic dissection cannot be prevented. Things you can do to reduce your risk include: Treating and controlling hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) Keeping high blood pressure under control, especially if you are at risk for dissection Taking safety precautions to prevent injuries that can cause dissections If you have been diagnosed with Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, making sure you regularly follow-up with your provider Alternative Names Aortic aneurysm - dissecting; Chest pain - aortic dissection; Thoracic aortic aneurysm - dissection Images Aortic rupture - chest x-ray Aortic aneurysm Aortic dissection References Beckman JA.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening lung condition that prevents enough oxygen from getting to the lungs and into the blood. Infants can also have respiratory distress syndrome . Causes ARDS can be caused by any major direct or indirect injury to the lung. Common causes include: Breathing vomit into the lungs ( aspiration ) Inhaling chemicals Lung transplant Pneumonia , including COVID-19 infection Septic shock (infection throughout the body) Transfusions (multiple) Trauma Depending on the amount of oxygen in the blood and during breathing, the severity of ARDS is classified as: Mild Moderate Severe ARDS leads to a buildup of fluid in the air sacs (alveoli). This fluid prevents enough oxygen from passing into the bloodstream. The fluid buildup also makes the lungs heavy and stiff. This decreases the lungs' ability to expand. The level of oxygen in the blood can stay dangerously low, even if the person receives oxygen from a breathing machine ( ventilator ) through a breathing tube (endotracheal tube). ARDS often occurs along with the failure of other organ systems, such as the heart, liver or kidneys . Cigarette smoking and heavy alcohol use may be risk factors for its development. Symptoms Symptoms usually develop within 24 to 48 hours of the injury or illness. Often, people with ARDS are so sick they cannot report symptoms. Symptoms can include any of the following: Shortness of breath Fast heartbeat Low blood pressure and organ failure Rapid breathing Exams and Tests Listening to the chest with a stethoscope ( auscultation ) reveals abnormal breath sounds, such as crackles, which may be signs of fluid in the lungs. Often, blood pressure is low. Blue skin, lips, and nails caused by lack of oxygen to the tissues ( cyanosis ) is often seen. Tests used to diagnose ARDS include: Arterial blood gas Blood tests, including CBC (complete blood count) and blood chemistries Blood and urine cultures Bronchoscopy in some people Chest x-ray or CT scan Sputum cultures and analysis Tests for possible infections An echocardiogram may be needed to rule out heart failure , which can look similar to ARDS on a chest x-ray. Treatment ARDS often needs to be treated in an intensive care unit (ICU). The goal of treatment is to provide breathing support and treat the cause of ARDS. This may involve medicines to treat infections, reduce inflammation, and remove fluid from the lungs. A ventilator is used to deliver high doses of oxygen and positive pressure to the damaged lungs. People often need to be deeply sedated with medicines. During treatment, your health care providers make every effort to protect your lungs from further damage. Certain ways of using the ventilator can protect your lungs better and improve chances of recovery. Treatment is mainly supportive until the lungs recover. Sometimes, a treatment called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is done. During ECMO, blood is filtered through a machine to provide oxygen and remove carbon dioxide. Support Groups Many family members of people with ARDS are under extreme stress. They can often relieve this stress by joining support groups where members share common experiences and problems. Outlook (Prognosis) About one third of people with ARDS die of the disease. Those who live often get back most of their normal lung function, but many people have permanent (usually mild) lung damage. Many people who survive ARDS have memory loss or other quality-of-life problems after they recover. This is due to brain damage that occurred when the lungs were not working properly and the brain was not getting enough oxygen. Some people can also have post-traumatic stress after surviving ARDS. Possible Complications Problems that may result from ARDS or its treatment include: Failure of many organ systems Lung damage, such as a collapsed lung (also called pneumothorax ) due to injury from the breathing machine needed to treat the disease Pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of the lung) Ventilator-associated pneumonia When to Contact a Medical Professional ARDS most often occurs during another illness, for which the person is already in the hospital. In some cases, a healthy person has severe pneumonia that gets worse and becomes ARDS. If you have trouble breathing, call your local emergency number (such as 911) or go to the emergency room.

The aorta is the main artery that carries blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. Blood flows out of the heart and into the aorta through the aortic valve. In people with aortic stenosis, the aortic valve does not open fully. This decreases blood flow from the heart. Causes As the aortic valve narrows, the left ventricle has to work harder to pump blood out through the valve. To do this extra work, the muscles in the ventricle walls become thicker. This can lead to chest pain. As the pressure continues to rise, blood may back up into the lungs. Severe aortic stenosis can limit the amount of blood that reaches the brain and the rest of the body. Aortic stenosis may be present from birth (congenital), but most often it develops later in life. Children with aortic stenosis may have other conditions present from birth. Aortic stenosis mainly occurs due to the buildup of calcium deposits that narrow the valve. This is called calcific aortic stenosis. The problem mostly affects older people. Calcium buildup of the valve happens sooner in people who are born with abnormal aortic or bicuspid valves. In rare cases, calcium buildup can develop more quickly when a person has received chest radiation (such as for cancer treatment). Another cause is rheumatic fever. This condition can develop after strep throat or scarlet fever. Valve problems do not develop for 5 to 10 years or longer after rheumatic fever occurs. Rheumatic fever is rare in the United States. Aortic stenosis occurs in about 2% of people over 65 years of age. It occurs more often in men than in women. Symptoms Most people with aortic stenosis do not develop symptoms until the disease is advanced. The diagnosis may have been made when the health care provider heard a heart murmur and performed tests before any symptoms developed. Symptoms of aortic stenosis include: Chest discomfort: The chest pain may get worse with activity and reach into the arm, neck, or jaw. The chest may also feel tight or squeezed. Cough, possibly bloody . Breathing problems when exercising. Becoming easily tired. Feeling the heartbeat ( palpitations ). Fainting , weakness, or dizziness with activity. In infants and children, symptoms include: Becoming easily tired with exertion (in mild cases) Failure to gain weight Poor feeding Serious breathing problems that develop within days or weeks of birth (in severe cases) Children with mild or moderate aortic stenosis may get worse as they get older. They are also at risk for a heart infection called bacterial endocarditis. Exams and Tests A heart murmur, click, or other abnormal sound is almost always heard through a stethoscope. The provider may be able to feel a vibration or movement when placing a hand over the heart. There may be a faint pulse or changes in the quality of the pulse in the neck. Blood pressure may be low. Aortic stenosis is most often diagnosed and then monitored using a test called a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The following tests may also be performed: Electrocardiogram (ECG) Exercise stress testing Left cardiac catheterization MRI of the heart Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) Treatment Regular checkups by a provider may be all that is needed if your symptoms are not severe. The provider should ask about your health history, do a physical exam, and perform an echocardiogram. People with severe aortic stenosis may be told not to play competitive sports, even if they have no symptoms. If symptoms do occur, strenuous activity must often be limited. Medicines are used to treat symptoms of heart failure or abnormal heart rhythms (most commonly atrial fibrillation). These include diuretics (water pills), nitrates, and beta-blockers. High blood pressure should also be treated. If aortic stenosis is severe, this treatment must be done carefully so blood pressure does not drop too far. In the past, most people with heart valve problems were given antibiotics before dental work or a procedure such as colonoscopy. The antibiotics were given to prevent an infection of the damaged heart. However, antibiotics are now used much less often before dental work and other procedures. Check with your provider to find out whether you need antibiotics. People with this and other heart conditions should stop smoking and be tested for high cholesterol. Surgery to repair or replace the valve is often done for adults or children who develop symptoms. Even if symptoms are not very bad, the provider may recommend surgery based on test results. A less invasive procedure called balloon valvuloplasty may be done instead of or before surgery. A balloon is placed into an artery in the groin, threaded to the heart, placed across the valve, and inflated. However, narrowing often occurs again after this procedure. A newer procedure done at the same time as valvuloplasty can implant an artificial valve ( transcatheter aortic valve replacement or TAVR). This procedure is becoming more common. Some children may need aortic valve repair or replacement. Children with mild aortic stenosis may be able to take part in most activities. Outlook (Prognosis) The outcome varies. The disorder may be mild and not produce symptoms. Over time, the aortic valve may become narrower. This may result in more severe heart problems such as: Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter Blood clots to the brain (stroke), intestines, kidneys, or other areas Fainting spells ( syncope ) Heart failure High blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs ( pulmonary hypertension ) The results of aortic valve replacement are often excellent. To get the best treatment, go to a center that regularly performs this type of surgery. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you or your child has symptoms of aortic stenosis. Also contact your provider right away if you have been diagnosed with this condition and your symptoms get worse or new symptoms develop.

Dementia is a loss of brain function that occurs with certain diseases. Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. It affects memory, thinking, and behavior. Dementia may also be referred to as major neurocognitive disorder . Causes The exact cause of Alzheimer disease is not known. Research shows that certain changes in the brain are associated with Alzheimer disease. This leads to structures called neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Most experts believe that this is the cause of Alzheimer disease but why this happens to some people is not known. You are more likely to develop Alzheimer disease if you: Are older -- Developing Alzheimer disease is not a part of normal aging. Have a close relative, such as a brother, sister, or parent with Alzheimer disease. Have certain genes linked to Alzheimer disease. The following may also increase the risk: Being female Having heart and blood vessel problems due to high cholesterol History of head trauma There are two types of Alzheimer disease: Early onset Alzheimer disease -- Symptoms appear before age 60. This type is much less common than late onset. It tends to get worse quickly. Early onset disease can run in families. Several genes have been identified. Late onset Alzheimer disease -- This is the most common type. It occurs in people age 60 and older. It may run in some families, but the role of genes is less clear. Watch this video about: Alzheimer disease Symptoms Alzheimer disease symptoms include difficulty with many areas of mental function, including: Emotional behavior or personality Language Memory Perception Thinking and judgment (cognitive skills) Alzheimer disease usually first appears as forgetfulness. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition in which a person has more memory and thinking problems than other people their age. People with MCI have mild problems with thinking and memory that do not interfere with daily activities. They are often aware of the forgetfulness. Not everyone with MCI develops Alzheimer disease. Symptoms of MCI include: Difficulty doing more than one task at a time Difficulty solving problems or making decisions Forgetting names of familiar people, recent events, or conversations Taking longer to do more difficult mental activities Early symptoms of Alzheimer disease can include: Difficulty performing tasks that take some thought, but used to come easily, such as balancing a checkbook, playing complex games (bridge), and learning new information or routines Getting lost on familiar routes Language problems, such as trouble remembering the names of familiar objects Losing interest in things previously enjoyed and being in a flat mood Misplacing items Personality changes and loss of social skills Mood changes leading to aggressive behavior Poor performance of job duties As Alzheimer disease becomes worse, symptoms are more obvious and interfere with the ability to take care of oneself. Symptoms may include: Change in sleep patterns, often waking up at night Delusions, depression , and agitation Difficulty doing basic tasks, such as preparing meals, choosing proper clothing, and driving Difficulty reading or writing Forgetting details about current events Forgetting events in one's life history and losing self-awareness Hallucinations , arguments, striking out, and violent behavior Poor judgment and loss of ability to recognize danger Using the wrong word, mispronouncing words, or speaking in confusing sentences Withdrawing from social contact People with severe Alzheimer disease can no longer: Recognize family members Perform basic activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing, and bathing Understand language Other symptoms that may occur with Alzheimer disease: Problems controlling bowel movements or urine Swallowing problems Exams and Tests A diagnosis of Alzheimer disease is made when certain symptoms are present, and by making sure other causes of dementia are not present. A skilled health care provider can often diagnose Alzheimer disease with the following steps: Performing a complete physical exam, including a nervous system exam. Asking about the person's medical history and symptoms. Mental function tests (mental status examination). Neuropsychological testing. PET scan and lumbar puncture (spinal tap) are sometimes needed to confirm Alzheimer disease. Tests may be done to rule out other possible causes of dementia, including: Anemia Brain tumor Long-term (chronic) infection Intoxication from medicines Severe depression Increased fluid on the brain (normal pressure hydrocephalus) Stroke Thyroid disease Vitamin deficiency CT or MRI of the brain may be done to look for other causes of dementia, such as a brain tumor or stroke. The only way to know for certain that someone has Alzheimer disease is to examine a sample of their brain tissue after death. Treatment There is no cure for Alzheimer disease. The goals of treatment are: Slow the progression of the disease (although this is difficult to do) Manage symptoms, such as behavior problems, confusion, and sleep problems Change the home environment to make daily activities easier Support family members and other caregivers Medicines are used to: Slow the rate at which symptoms worsen, though the benefit from using these medicines may be small Lower the amount of beta amyloid protein in the brain Control problems with behavior, such as loss of judgment or confusion Before using these medicines, ask your provider: What are the side effects? Is the medicine worth the risk? When is the best time, if any, to use these medicines? Do medicines for other health problems need to be changed or stopped? Someone with Alzheimer disease will need support in the home as the disease gets worse. Family members or other caregivers can help by helping the person cope with memory loss and behavior and sleep problems . It is important to make sure the home of a person who has Alzheimer disease is safe for them . Support Groups Having Alzheimer disease or caring for a person with the condition may be a challenge. You can ease the stress of illness by seeking support through Alzheimer disease resources . Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. Outlook (Prognosis) How quickly Alzheimer disease gets worse is different for each person. If Alzheimer disease develops quickly, it is more likely to worsen quickly. People with Alzheimer disease often die earlier than normal, although a person may live anywhere from 3 to 20 years after diagnosis. Families will likely need to plan for their loved one's future care. The final phase of the disease may last from a few months to several years. During that time, the person becomes totally disabled. Death usually occurs from an infection or organ failure. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if: Alzheimer disease symptoms develop or a person has a sudden change in mental status The condition of a person with Alzheimer disease gets worse You are unable to care for a person with Alzheimer disease at home Prevention Although there is no proven way to prevent Alzheimer disease, there are some measures that may help prevent or slow the onset of Alzheimer disease: Stay on a low-fat diet and eat foods high in omega-3 fatty acids. Get plenty of exercise. Stay mentally and socially active. Wear a helmet during risky activities to prevent brain injury.

Endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is surgery to repair a widened area in your aorta. This is called an aneurysm. The aorta is the large artery that carries blood from your heart to your belly, pelvis, and legs. An aortic aneurysm is when a part of this artery becomes too large or balloons outward. It occurs due to weakness in the wall of the artery. Description This procedure is done in an operating room, in the radiology department of the hospital, or in a catheterization lab. You will lie on a padded table. You may receive general anesthesia (you are asleep and pain-free) or epidural or spinal anesthesia. During the procedure, your surgeon will: Make a small surgical cut near the groin, to find the femoral artery. Insert a thin, flexible tube (catheter) into the artery through the cut. Insert a stent (a metal coil) and a man-made (synthetic) graft along the catheter. Then use a dye to define the extent of the aneurysm. Use x-rays to guide the stent graft up into your aorta, to where the aneurysm is located. Next open the stent using a spring-like mechanism and attach it to the walls of the aorta. Your aneurysm will eventually shrink around it. Use x-rays and dye again to make sure the graft is in the right place and your aneurysm is not bleeding inside your body. Remove the catheter and close the surgical cut where the catheter was inserted. Why the Procedure is Performed Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is done because your aneurysm is very large, growing quickly, or is leaking or bleeding. You may have an AAA that is not causing any symptoms or problems. Your health care provider may have found this problem when you had an ultrasound or CT scan for another reason. There is a risk that this aneurysm may burst (rupture) if you do not have surgery to repair it. However, surgery to repair the aneurysm may also be risky. In such cases, EVAR is an option. You and your provider must decide whether the risk of having this surgery is smaller than the risk for rupture if you do not have surgery to repair the problem. The provider is more likely to recommend that you have surgery if the aneurysm is: Larger (about 2 inches or 5 centimeters) Growing more quickly (a little less than 1/4 inch or 0.5 centimeter over the last 6 to 12 months) EVAR has a lower risk of developing complications compared to open surgery. Your provider is more likely to suggest this type of repair if you have other serious medical problems or are an older person. Risks Risks of any surgery are: Blood clots in the legs that may travel to the lungs Breathing problems Infection, including in the lungs, urinary tract, and belly Heart attack or stroke Reactions to medicines Risks of this surgery are: Bleeding around the graft that needs more surgery Bleeding before or after procedure Blockage of the stent Damage to a nerve, causing weakness, pain, or numbness in the leg Kidney failure Poor blood supply to your legs, your kidneys, or other organs Problems getting or keeping an erection Surgery is not successful and you need an open surgery The stent graft slips The graft leaks and requires open surgery Death Before the Procedure Your provider will examine you and order tests before you have surgery. Always tell your provider what drugs you are taking, even drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription. If you are a smoker, you should stop. Your provider can help. Here are other things you will need to do before your surgery: About two weeks before your surgery, you will visit your provider to make sure any medical problems, such as diabetes , high blood pressure , and heart or lung problems, are well treated. You also may be asked to stop taking drugs that make it harder for your blood to clot. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), clopidogrel (Plavix), warfarin (Coumadin), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). Ask which drugs you should still take on the day of your surgery. Always tell your provider if you get a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness before your surgery. The evening before your surgery: DO NOT drink anything after midnight, including water. On the day of your surgery: Take any medicines your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water. You will be told when to arrive at the hospital. After the Procedure Most people stay in the hospital for a few days after this surgery, depending on the type of procedure they had. Most often, the recovery from this procedure is faster and with less pain than with open surgery. Also, you will most likely be able to go home sooner. During a hospital stay, you may: Be in the intensive care unit (ICU), where you will be watched very closely at first Have a urinary catheter Be given medicines to thin your blood Be encouraged to sit on the side of your bed and then walk Wear special stockings to prevent blood clots in your legs Receive pain medicine into your veins or into the space that surrounds your spinal cord (epidural) Outlook (Prognosis) Recovery after endovascular repair is quick in most cases. You will need to be watched and checked regularly to make sure your repaired aortic aneurysm is not leaking blood.

Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease (anti-GBM disease) is a rare disorder that can involve quickly worsening kidney failure and lung disease. Some forms of the disease involve just the lungs or the kidneys. Anti-GBM disease used to be known as Goodpasture syndrome. Causes Anti-GBM disease is an autoimmune disorder . It occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue. People with this syndrome develop substances that attack a protein called collagen in the tiny air sacs in the lungs and the filtering units (glomeruli) of the kidneys. These substances are called antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies. The glomerular basement membrane is a part of the kidneys that helps filter waste and extra fluid from the blood. Antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies are antibodies against this membrane. They can damage the basement membrane, which can lead to kidney damage. Sometimes, this disorder is triggered by a viral respiratory infection or by breathing in hydrocarbon solvents. In such cases, the immune system may attack organs or tissues because it mistakes them for these viruses or foreign chemicals. The immune system's faulty response causes bleeding in the air sacs of the lungs and inflammation in the kidney's filtering units. Symptoms Symptoms may occur very slowly over months or even years, but they often develop very quickly over days to weeks. Loss of appetite, fatigue, and weakness are common early symptoms. Lung symptoms may include: Coughing up blood Dry cough Shortness of breath Kidney and other symptoms include: Bloody urine Burning sensation when urinating Nausea and vomiting Pale skin Swelling (edema) in any area of the body, especially in the legs Exams and Tests A physical exam may reveal high blood pressure and signs of fluid overload. Your health care provider may hear abnormal heart and lung sounds when listening to the chest with a stethoscope. Urinalysis results are often abnormal and show blood and protein in the urine. Abnormal red blood cells may be seen. The following tests may also be done: Antiglomerular basement membrane test Arterial blood gas BUN Chest x-ray Creatinine (serum) Lung biopsy Kidney biopsy Treatment The main goal is to remove the harmful antibodies from the blood. Treatment may include: Plasmapheresis, which removes harmful antibodies to help reduce inflammation in the kidneys and lungs. Corticosteroid medicines (such as prednisone) and other drugs, which suppress or quiet the immune system. Medicines such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which help control blood pressure. Dialysis , which may be done if kidney failure is severe and can no longer be treated by other means. A kidney transplant , which may be done when your kidneys no longer function. You may be told to limit your intake of salt and fluids to control swelling. In some cases, a low-to-moderate protein diet may be recommended. Support Groups More information and support for people with anti-GBM disease and their families can be found at: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases -- www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/glomerular-diseases/anti-gbm-goodpastures-disease National Kidney Foundation -- www.kidney.org/atoz/content/goodpasture National Organization for Rare Disorders -- rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/goodpasture-syndrome Outlook (Prognosis) An early diagnosis is very important. The outlook is much worse if the kidneys are already severely damaged when treatment begins. Lung damage can range from mild to severe. Many people will need dialysis or a kidney transplant. Possible Complications Untreated, this condition can lead to any of the following: Chronic kidney disease End-stage kidney disease Lung failure Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis Severe pulmonary hemorrhage (lung bleeding) When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider for an appointment if you are producing less urine, or you have any other symptoms of anti-GBM disease. Prevention Never sniff glue or siphon gasoline with your mouth, which exposes the lungs to hydrocarbon solvents and can cause the disease.

Alcohol use involves drinking beer, wine, or hard liquor. Information Alcohol is one of the most widely used drug substances in the world. TEEN DRINKING Alcohol use is not only an adult problem. It's a teen problem too. Most American high school seniors have had an alcoholic drink within the past month. This is in spite of the fact that the legal drinking age is 21 years old in the United States. About 15 percent of teens report using alcohol in the past month. About 8 percent of teens report binge drinking in the past month. Many of these are problem drinkers. This means that they: Get drunk Have accidents related to alcohol use Get into trouble with the law, family members, friends, school, or dates because of alcohol THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL Alcoholic drinks have different amounts of alcohol in them. Beer is about 5% alcohol, although some beers have more. Wine is usually 12% to 17% alcohol. Hard liquor is about 40% alcohol. Alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly. The amount and type of food in your stomach can change how quickly this occurs. For example, high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly. Certain types of alcoholic drinks get into your bloodstream faster. Stronger drinks tend to be absorbed faster. Alcohol slows your breathing rate, heart rate, and how well your brain functions. These effects may appear within 10 minutes and peak at around 40 to 60 minutes. Alcohol stays in your bloodstream until it is broken down by the liver. The amount of alcohol in your blood is called your blood alcohol level. If you drink alcohol faster than the liver can break it down, this level rises. Your blood alcohol level is used to legally define whether or not you are drunk. The legal limit for blood alcohol is 0.08 in the United States. Below is a list of blood alcohol levels and the likely symptoms: 0.05 -- reduced inhibitions 0.10 -- slurred speech 0.20 -- euphoria and motor impairment 0.30 -- confusion 0.40 and over -- stupor, coma, breathing stops and death You can have symptoms of being drunk at blood alcohol levels below the legal definition of being drunk. Also, people who drink alcohol frequently may not have symptoms until a higher blood alcohol level is reached. HEALTH RISKS OF ALCOHOL Alcohol consumption increases the risk of: Alcoholism Falls, drownings, and other accidents Head, neck, stomach, colon, breast, and other cancers Heart attack and stroke Motor vehicle accidents Risky sex behaviors, unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) Suicide and homicide Drinking during pregnancy can harm the developing baby. Severe birth defects or fetal alcohol syndrome are possible. RESPONSIBLE DRINKING If you drink alcohol, it is best to do so in moderation. Moderation means the drinking is not getting you intoxicated (or drunk) and you are drinking no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman and no more than 2 if you are a man. A drink is defined as 12 ounces (oz) or 350 milliliters (mL) of beer, 5 oz or 150 mL of wine, or 1.5 oz or 45 (mL) of liquor. Here are some ways to drink responsibly, provided you do not have a drinking problem, are of legal age to drink alcohol, and are not pregnant: Never drink alcohol and drive a car. If you are going to drink, have a designated driver, or plan an alternative way home, such as a taxi, rideshare, or bus. Do not drink on an empty stomach. Snack before and while drinking alcohol. If you are taking medicines, including over-the-counter medicines, check with your health care provider before drinking alcohol. Alcohol can make the effects of many medicines stronger. It can also interact with other medicines, making them ineffective, dangerous, or make you sick. If alcohol misuse runs in your family, you may be at increased risk of developing this disease yourself. So, you may want to avoid drinking alcohol altogether . CONTACT YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IF: You are concerned about your personal alcohol use or that of a family member You are interested in more information regarding alcohol use or support groups You are unable to reduce or stop your alcohol consumption, in spite of attempts to stop drinking Other resources include: Local Alcoholics Anonymous or Al-Anon/Alateen groups Local hospitals Public or private mental health agencies School or work counselors Student or employee health centers If you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org . You can also call 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides free and confidential support 24/7, anytime day or night. You can also call 911 or the local emergency number or go to the hospital emergency room. DO NOT delay. If someone you know has attempted suicide, call 911 or the local emergency number right away. DO NOT leave the person alone, even after you have called for help.

Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve mild to moderate aches and pains, swelling, and fever. Aspirin overdose occurs when someone accidentally or intentionally takes more than the recommended amount of this medicine. This can happen in two ways: If a person takes a very large dose of aspirin at one time, it is called an acute overdose. If a normal daily dose of aspirin builds up in the body over time and causes symptoms, it is called a chronic overdose. This may happen if your kidneys do not work correctly or when you are dehydrated. Chronic overdoses are usually seen in older people during hot weather. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. Poisonous Ingredient Acetylsalicylic acid Where Found Aspirin is also known as acetylsalicylic acid and can be found in many prescription and over-the-counter pain relievers, including: Alka Seltzer Anacin Bayer Bufferin Ecotrin Excedrin Fiorinal Percodan St. Joseph's Note: This list may not be all-inclusive. Symptoms Airways and lungs: Rapid breathing Slow, labored breathing Wheezing Eyes, ears, nose, and throat: Ringing in the ears Blurred vision Nervous system: Agitation, confusion, incoherence (not understandable) Collapse Coma (lack of responsiveness) Seizures Drowsiness Headache (severe) Unsteadiness, problems moving Skin: Rash Stomach and intestines: Diarrhea Heartburn Nausea, vomiting (sometimes bloody) Stomach pain (possible bleeding in the stomach and intestines) Symptoms of chronic overdose may include: Fatigue Slight fever Confusion Collapse Rapid heart beat Uncontrollable rapid breathing Before Calling Emergency The following information is helpful for emergency assistance: Person's age, weight, and condition Name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known) Time it was swallowed Amount swallowed However, DO NOT delay calling for help if this information is not immediately available. Poison Control Your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible. What to Expect at the Emergency Room The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. The person may receive: Activated charcoal Airway support, including oxygen, breathing tube through the mouth (intubation), and ventilator (breathing machine) Blood and urine tests including a blood salicylate level Chest x-ray ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing) Fluids through the vein (intravenous or IV) Laxative Medicines to treat symptoms Other medicines may be given through a vein, including potassium salt and sodium bicarbonate, which helps the body remove aspirin that has already been absorbed. If these treatments do not work or the overdose is extremely severe, hemodialysis (kidney machine) may be needed to reverse the condition. In rare cases, a breathing machine may be needed. Many poisoning experts think this causes more harm than good, so it is only used as a very last resort. Outlook (Prognosis) A toxic dose of aspirin is 200 to 300 mg/kg (milligrams per kilogram of body weight), and ingestion of 500 mg/kg is potentially lethal. In chronic overdose a lower level of aspirin in the body can result in serious illness. Much lower levels can affect children. If treatment is delayed or the overdose is large enough, symptoms will continue to get worse. Breathing becomes extremely fast or may stop. Seizures, high fevers, or death may occur. How well you do depends greatly on how much aspirin your body has absorbed and how much is flowing through your blood. If you take a large amount of aspirin but come quickly to the emergency room, treatments may help keep your blood levels of aspirin very low. If you do not get to the emergency room fast enough, the level of aspirin in your blood can become dangerously high. Alternative Names Acetylsalicylic acid overdose References Aronson JK.

Eczema is a chronic skin disorder characterized by scaly and itchy rashes. Atopic dermatitis is the most common type. Atopic dermatitis is due to a skin reaction pattern, similar to an allergy that causes long-term inflammation of the skin. Most people with atopic dermatitis also are missing certain proteins from the surface of the skin. These proteins are important in maintaining the skin barrier function. As a result, their skin is more easily irritated by minor irritants. Taking care of your skin at home may reduce the need for medicines. Alternative names Eczema - self-care Help for Itching and Scratching Try not to scratch the rash or your skin in the inflamed area. Relieve the itch by using moisturizers, topical steroids, or other prescribed creams. Keep your child's fingernails cut short. Consider light gloves if nighttime scratching is a problem. Antihistamines taken by mouth may help with itching if you have allergies. Often you can buy them over-the-counter. Some antihistamines can cause sleepiness. But they may help with scratching while you sleep. Newer antihistamines cause little or no sleepiness. However, they may not be as effective in controlling the itch. These include: Fexofenadine (Allegra) Loratadine (Claritin, Alavert) Cetirizine (Zyrtec) Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or hydroxyzine may be taken at nighttime to relieve itching and allow for sleep. Day-to-day Skin Care Keep your skin lubricated or moisturized. Use ointment (such as petroleum jelly), cream, or lotion 2 to 3 times a day. Moisturizers should be free of alcohol, scents, dyes, fragrances, or chemicals you know you are allergic to. Having a humidifier in the home may also help. Moisturizers and emollients work best when they are applied to skin that is wet or damp. These products soften the skin and help it retain moisture. After washing or bathing, pat the skin dry and then apply the moisturizer right away. Different types of emollients or moisturizers may be used at different times of the day. For the most part, you can apply these substances as often as you need to keep your skin soft. Avoid anything that makes your symptoms worse. These may include: Foods, such as eggs in a very young child. Always discuss with your health care provider first. Wool, and other scratchy fabrics. Use smooth, textured clothing and bedding, such as cotton. Sweating. Be careful not to over dress during warmer weather. Strong soaps or detergents, as well as chemicals and solvents. Sudden changes in body temperature and stress, which may cause sweating and worsen your condition. Triggers that cause allergy symptoms. When washing or bathing: Bathe less often and keep water contact as brief as possible. Short, cooler baths are better than long, hot baths. The same is true for showers. Use gentle skin care cleansers rather than traditional soaps. Use these products only on your face, underarms, genital areas, hands, and feet, or to remove visible dirt. Do not scrub or dry the skin too hard or for too long. After bathing, it is important to apply lubricating cream, lotion, or ointment on the skin while it is damp. This will help trap moisture in the skin. The rash itself, as well as the scratching, often causes breaks in the skin and may lead to infection. Keep an eye out for redness, warmth, swelling, or other signs of infection. Medicines From Your Doctor Topical corticosteroids are medicines used to treat conditions where your skin becomes red, sore, or inflamed. "Topical" means you place it on your skin. Topical corticosteroids may also be called topical steroids or topical cortisones. These medicines help "calm" your skin when it is irritated. Your provider will tell you how much of this medicine to use and how often. Do not use more medicine or use it more often than you are told. You may need other prescription medicines such as barrier repair creams. These help to replenish the normal surface of your skin and rebuild the broken barrier. Your provider may give you other medicines to use on your skin or take by mouth. Be sure to follow the directions carefully.

Macular degeneration is an eye disorder that slowly destroys sharp, central vision. This makes it difficult to see fine details and read. The disease is most common in people over age 60, which is why it is often called age-related macular degeneration (ARMD or AMD). Watch this video about: Macular degeneration Causes The retina is at the back of the eye. It changes light and images that enter the eye into nerve signals that are sent to the brain. A part of the retina called the macula makes vision sharper and more detailed. It is a yellow spot in the center of the retina. It has a high amount of two natural colors (pigments) called lutein and zeaxanthin. AMD is caused by damage to the blood vessels that supply the macula. This change also harms the macula. There are two types of AMD: Dry AMD occurs when the blood vessels under the macula become thin and brittle. Small yellow deposits, called drusen, form. Almost all people with macular degeneration start with the dry form. Wet AMD occurs in about 10% of people with macular degeneration. New abnormal and very fragile blood vessels grow under the macula. These vessels leak blood and fluid. This type of AMD causes most of the vision loss associated with the condition. Health care providers are not sure what causes AMD. The condition is rare before age 55. It occurs mostly in people 75 years or older. Risk factors for AMD are: Family history of AMD Being White Cigarette smoking High-fat diet Being female Symptoms You may not have any symptoms at first. As the disease gets worse, you may have problems with your central vision. SYMPTOMS OF DRY AMD The most common symptom of dry AMD is blurred vision. Objects in the center part of your vision often look distorted and dim, and colors look faded. You may have trouble reading print or seeing other details. But you can see well enough to walk and do most daily activities. As dry AMD gets worse, you may need more light to read or do everyday tasks. A blurred spot in the center of vision gradually gets larger and darker. In the later stages of dry AMD, you may not be able to recognize faces until they are close. SYMPTOMS OF WET AMD The most common early symptom of wet AMD is that straight lines look distorted and wavy. There may be a small dark spot in the center of your vision that gets larger over time. With both types of AMD, central vision loss can occur quickly. If this happens, you will need to be seen right away by an ophthalmologist. Make sure this eye doctor has experience in treating problems with the retina. Exams and Tests You will have an eye exam. Drops will be placed into your eyes to widen (dilate) your pupils. Your eye doctor will use special lenses to view your retina, blood vessels, and optic nerve. Your eye doctor will look for specific changes in the macula and blood vessels and for drusen. You may be asked to cover one eye and look at a pattern of lines called an Amsler grid. If the straight lines look wavy, it may be a sign of AMD. The American Macular Degeneration Foundation has an Amsler grid you can download along with instructions for how to check your vision. Other tests that may be done include: Using special dye and camera to look at blood flow in the retina ( fluorescein angiogram ) Taking a photo of the inner lining of the eye (fundus photography) Using light waves to view the retina (optical coherence tomography) A test that measures the pigment in the macula Treatment If you have advanced or severe dry AMD, no treatment can restore your vision. If you have early AMD and do not smoke, a combination of certain vitamins, antioxidants, and zinc may prevent the disease from getting worse. But it cannot give you back vision that is already lost. The combination is often called the "AREDS" formula. The supplements contain: 500 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C 400 international units (IU) of vitamin E 15 mg beta-carotene 80 mg of zinc 2 mg of copper Only take this vitamin combination if your eye doctor recommends it. Make sure your eye doctor knows about any other vitamins or supplements you are taking. Smokers should not use this supplement. AREDS may also benefit you if you have a family history and risk factors for AMD. Lutein and zeaxanthin, which are substances found in green leafy vegetables, may also decrease your risk for age-related macular degeneration. If you have wet AMD, your eye doctor may recommend: Laser surgery ( laser photocoagulation ) -- a small beam of light destroys the leaking, abnormal blood vessels. Photodynamic therapy -- a light activates a medicine that is injected into your body to destroy leaking blood vessels. Special medicines that prevent new blood vessels from forming in the eye are injected into the eye (this is an uncomfortable but painless process). Low-vision aids (such as special lenses) and therapy can help you use the vision that you have more effectively, and improve your quality of life. Close follow-up with your eye doctor is important. For dry AMD, visit your eye doctor once a year for a complete eye exam. For wet AMD, you likely need frequent, perhaps monthly, follow-up visits. Early detection of vision changes is important because the sooner you are treated, the better your outcome. Early detection leads to earlier treatment and often, a better outcome. The best way to detect changes is by self-testing at home with the Amsler grid. Your eye doctor can give you a copy of the grid or you can print one from the Internet. Test each eye individually while wearing your reading glasses. If the lines look wavy, call your eye doctor right away for an appointment. Treatments in development: Stem cell research is showing some promise in restoring some vision in AMD. But this type of treatment is still years away at this point. Similarly, gene therapy may also have a place in the treatment of AMD. Levodopa, while most commonly used to treat Parkinson disease, may have a beneficial effect on wet AMD. Support Groups These resources may provide more information on macular degeneration: Macular Degeneration Association -- macularhope.org National Eye Institute -- www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/age-related-macular-degeneration Outlook (Prognosis) AMD does not affect side (peripheral) vision. This means complete vision loss never occurs. AMD results in the loss of central vision only. Mild, dry AMD usually does not cause disabling central vision loss. Wet AMD often leads to significant vision loss. In general, with AMD you may lose the ability to read, drive a car, and recognize faces at a distance. But most people with AMD can carry out daily tasks without much difficulty. When to Contact a Medical Professional If you have AMD, your eye doctor may recommend that you check your vision every day with an Amsler grid. Contact your provider right away if the lines look wavy. Also contact your eye doctor if you notice other changes in your vision. Prevention Although there is no known way to prevent macular degeneration, leading a healthy lifestyle can reduce your risk of developing AMD: Do not smoke Maintain a healthy diet that is high in fruits and vegetables and low in animal fat Exercise regularly Maintain a healthy weight See your eye doctor regularly for dilated eye exams.

Angina is a type of chest discomfort due to poor blood flow through the blood vessels of the heart muscle. This article discusses how to care for yourself when you leave the hospital. When You're in the Hospital You were having angina. Angina is chest pain, chest pressure, often associated with shortness of breath. You had this problem when your heart was not getting enough blood and oxygen. You may or may not have had a heart attack. What to Expect at Home You may feel sad. You may feel anxious and that you have to be very careful about what you do. All of these feelings are normal. They go away for most people after 2 or 3 weeks. You may also feel tired when you leave the hospital. You should feel better and have more energy within 5 weeks after you are discharged from the hospital. Activity Know the signs and symptoms of angina: You may feel pressure, squeezing, burning, or tightness in your chest. You may also have pressure, squeezing, burning, or tightness in your arms, shoulders, neck, jaw, throat, or back. Some people may feel discomfort in their back, shoulders, and stomach area. You may have indigestion or feel sick to your stomach. You may feel tired and be short of breath, sweaty, lightheaded, or weak. You may have these symptoms during physical activity, such as climbing stairs, walking uphill, lifting, and engaging in sexual activity. You may have symptoms more often in cold weather. You can also have symptoms when you are resting, or when wake you up from your sleep. Ask your health care provider how to treat your chest pain when it happens. Take it easy at first. You should be able to talk easily when you are doing any activity. If you cannot, stop the activity. Ask your provider about returning to work and what type of work you will be able to do. Your provider may refer you to a cardiac rehabilitation program. This will help you learn how to slowly increase your exercise. You will also learn how to take care of your heart disease . Diet and lifestyle Try to limit how much alcohol you drink. Ask your provider when it is OK to drink, and how much is safe. Don't smoke cigarettes. If you do smoke, ask your provider for help quitting. Don't let anyone smoke in your home. Learn more about what you should eat for a healthier heart and blood vessels. Avoid salty and fatty foods. Stay away from fast-food restaurants. Your provider can refer you to a dietitian, who can help you plan a healthy diet. Try to avoid stressful situations. If you feel stressed or sad, tell your provider. They can refer you to a counselor. Ask your provider about sexual activity. Men should not take medicines or any herbal supplements for erection problems without checking with their provider first. These medicines are not safe when used with nitroglycerin. Taking your heart medicines Have all of your prescriptions filled before you go home. You should take your medicines the way you have been told. Ask your provider if you can still take other prescription medicines, herbs, or supplements you have been taking. Take your medicines with water or juice. Do not drink grapefruit juice (or eat grapefruit), since these foods may change how your body absorbs certain medicines. Ask your provider or pharmacist about this. People who have angina often receive the medicines below. But sometimes these medicines may not be safe to take. Talk with your provider if you are not already taking one of these medicines: Antiplatelet medicines (blood thinners), such as aspirin , clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Efient), or ticagrelor (Brilinta) Other medicines, such as warfarin (Coumadin), to help keep your blood from clotting Beta-blockers and ACE inhibitor medicines, to help protect your heart Statins or other medicines to lower your cholesterol Never just stop taking any of these medicines. Don't stop taking any other medicines you may be taking for diabetes, high blood pressure, or any other medical problems. If you are taking a blood thinner, you may need to have extra blood tests to make sure your dose is correct. When to Call the Doctor Contact your provider if you feel: Pain, pressure, tightness, or heaviness in the chest, arm, neck, or jaw Shortness of breath Gas pains or indigestion Numbness in your arms Sweaty, or if you lose color Lightheaded Changes in your angina may mean your heart disease is getting worse.

Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is bleeding from the uterus that is longer than usual or that occurs at an irregular time. Bleeding may be heavier or lighter than usual and occur often or randomly. AUB can occur: As spotting or bleeding between your periods After sex For more days than your normal period Heavier than normal After menopause It does not occur during pregnancy. Bleeding during pregnancy has different causes. If you have any bleeding when you are pregnant, be sure to contact your health care provider. Causes Every woman's menstrual cycle is different. On average, a woman's period (menstrual flow) occurs every 28 days, although cycles may vary from 24 to 34 days. Menstruation flow normally last about 4 to 7 days. Young girls may get their periods anywhere from 21 to 45 days or more apart. Women in their 40s may start to have their period less often or have the interval between their periods decrease. For most women, female hormone levels change every month. The hormones estrogen and progesterone are released as part of the process of ovulation. When a woman ovulates, an egg is released. AUB can occur when the ovaries do not release an egg. Changes in hormone levels cause your period to be later or earlier. Your period may sometimes be heavier than normal. AUB is more common in teenagers or in premenopausal women. Women who are overweight also may be more likely to have AUB. In many women, AUB is caused by a hormone imbalance. It can also occur due to following causes: Thickening of the uterine wall or lining Uterine fibroids Uterine polyps Cancers of ovaries, uterus, cervix, or vagina Bleeding disorders or problems with blood clotting Polycystic ovary syndrome Severe weight loss Hormonal birth control, such as birth control pills or intrauterine devices (IUD) Excessive weight gain or loss (more than 10 pounds or 4.5 kilograms) Infection of the uterus or cervix Symptoms AUB is unpredictable. The bleeding may be very heavy or light, and can occur often or randomly. Symptoms of AUB may include: Bleeding or spotting from the vagina between periods Periods that occur less than 28 days apart (more common) or more than 35 days apart Time between periods changes each month Heavier bleeding (such as passing large clots, needing to change protection during the night, soaking through a sanitary pad or tampon every hour for 2 to 3 hours in a row) Bleeding that lasts for more days than normal or for more than 7 days Other symptoms caused by changes in hormone levels may include: Excessive growth of body hair in a male pattern ( hirsutism ) Hot flashes Mood swings Tenderness and dryness of the vagina A woman may feel tired or fatigued if she loses too much blood over time. This is a symptom of anemia . Exams and Tests Your provider will rule out other possible causes of irregular bleeding. You will likely have a pelvic exam and Pap/HPV test. Other tests that may be done include: Complete blood count (CBC) Blood clotting profile Liver function tests (LFT) Fasting blood glucose Hormone tests, for FSH , LH , male hormone (androgen) levels, prolactin, and progesterone Pregnancy test Thyroid function tests Your provider may recommend the following: Culture to look for infection Biopsy to check for precancer, cancer, or to help decide on hormone treatment Hysteroscopy, performed in your provider's office to look into the uterus through the vagina Ultrasound to look for problems in the uterus or pelvis Saline infusion sonohysterogram to further evaluate the uterine cavity for a source of the bleeding Treatment Treatment may include one or more of the following: Low-dose birth control pills Hormone therapy High-dose estrogen therapy for women with very heavy bleeding Intrauterine device (IUD) that releases the hormone progestin Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) taken just before the period starts Tranexamic acid is a prescription medicine that treats heavy menstrual bleeding. It comes in a tablet and is taken each month at the start of the menstrual period. Surgery, if the cause of the bleeding is a polyp or fibroid Your provider may put you on iron supplements if you have anemia. If you want to get pregnant, you may be given medicine to stimulate ovulation. Women with severe symptoms that don't improve or who have a cancerous or precancerous diagnosis may require other procedures such as: Surgical procedure to destroy or remove the lining of the uterus Hysterectomy to remove the uterus Outlook (Prognosis) Hormone therapy often relieves symptoms. Treatment may not be needed if you do not develop anemia due to blood loss. A treatment focused on the cause of the bleeding is often immediately effective. That is why it's important to understand the cause. Possible Complications Complications that may occur: Infertility (inability to get pregnant) Severe anemia due to a lot of blood loss over time Increased risk for endometrial cancer When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have unusual vaginal bleeding.

All vital organs begin to lose some function as you age. Aging changes occur in all of the body's cells, tissues, and organs, and these changes affect the functioning of all body systems. Living tissue is made up of cells. There are many different types of cells, but all have the same basic structure. Tissues are layers of similar cells that perform a specific function. The different kinds of tissues group together to form organs. There are four basic types of tissue: Connective tissue supports other tissues and binds them together. This includes bone, blood, and lymph tissues, as well as the tissues that give support and structure to the skin and internal organs. Epithelial tissue provides a covering for superficial and deeper body layers. The skin and the linings of the passages inside the body, such as the gastrointestinal system, are made of epithelial tissue. Muscle tissue includes three types of tissue: Striated muscles, such as those that move the skeleton (also called voluntary muscle) Smooth muscles (also called involuntary muscle), such as the muscles contained in the stomach and other internal organs like the female uterus Cardiac muscle, which makes up most of the heart wall (also an involuntary muscle) Nerve tissue is made up of nerve cells (neurons) and is used to carry messages to and from various parts of the body. The brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves are made of nerve tissue. Watch this video about: Nerve conduction AGING CHANGES Cells are the basic building blocks of tissues. All cells experience changes with aging. They become larger and are less able to divide and multiply. Among other changes, there is an increase in pigments and fatty substances inside the cell (lipids). Many cells lose their ability to function, or they begin to function abnormally. As aging continues, waste products build up in tissue. A fatty brown pigment called lipofuscin collects in many tissues, as do other fatty substances. Connective tissue changes, becoming more stiff. This makes the organs, blood vessels, and airways more rigid. Cell membranes change, so many tissues have more trouble getting oxygen and nutrients and removing carbon dioxide and other wastes. Many tissues lose mass. This process is called atrophy. Some tissues become lumpy (nodular) or more rigid. Because of cell and tissue changes, your organs also change as you age. Aging organs slowly lose function. Most people do not notice this loss immediately, because you rarely need to use your organs to their fullest ability. Organs have a reserve ability to function beyond the usual needs. For example, the heart of a 20-year-old is capable of pumping about 10 times the amount of blood that is actually needed to keep the body alive. After age 30, an average of 1% of this reserve is lost each year. The biggest changes in organ reserve occur in the heart, lungs, and kidneys. The amount of reserve lost varies between people and between different organs in a single person. These changes appear slowly and over a long period. When an organ is worked harder than usual, it may not be able to increase function. Sudden heart failure or other problems can develop when the body is worked harder than usual. Things that produce an extra workload (body stressors) include the following: Illness Medicines Overactive thyroid gland Significant life changes Sudden increased physical demands on the body, such as a change in activity or exposure to a higher altitude Loss of reserve also makes it harder to restore balance (equilibrium) in the body. Drugs are removed from the body by the kidneys and liver at a slower rate. Lower doses of medicines may be needed, and side effects become more common. Recovery from illnesses is seldom 100%, leading to more and more disability. Side effects of medicine can mimic the symptoms of many diseases, so it is easy to mistake a drug reaction for an illness. Some medicines have entirely different side effects in the elderly than in younger people. AGING THEORY No one knows how and why people change as they get older. Some theories claim that aging is caused by injuries from ultraviolet light over time, wear and tear on the body, or byproducts of metabolism . Other theories view aging as a predetermined process controlled by genes. No single process can explain all the changes of aging. Aging is a complex process that varies as to how it affects different people and even different organs. Most gerontologists (people who study aging) feel that aging is due to the interaction of many lifelong influences. These influences include heredity, environment, culture, diet, exercise and leisure, past illnesses, and many other factors. Unlike the changes of adolescence, which are predictable to within a few years, each person ages at a unique rate. Some systems begin aging as early as age 30. Other aging processes are not common until much later in life. Although some changes always occur with aging, they occur at different rates and to different extents. There is no way to predict exactly how you will age. TERMS TO DESCRIBE TYPES OF CELL CHANGES Atrophy: Cells shrink. If enough cells decrease in size, the entire organ atrophies. This is often a normal aging change and can occur in any tissue. It is most common in skeletal muscle, the heart, the brain, and the sex organs (such as the breasts and ovaries). Bones become thinner and more likely to break with minor trauma. The cause of atrophy is unknown, but may include reduced use, decreased workload, decreased blood supply or nutrition to the cells, and reduced stimulation by nerves or hormones. Hypertrophy: Cells enlarge. This is caused by an increase of proteins in the cell membrane and cell structures, not an increase in the cell's fluid. When some cells atrophy, others may hypertrophy to make up for the loss of cell mass. Hyperplasia: The number of cells increases. There is an increased rate of cell division. Hyperplasia usually occurs to compensate for a loss of cells. It allows some organs and tissues to regenerate, including the skin, lining of the intestines, liver, and bone marrow. The liver is especially good at regeneration. It can replace up to 70% of its structure within 2 weeks after an injury. Tissues that have limited ability to regenerate include bone, cartilage, and smooth muscle (such as the muscles around the intestines). Ongoing research suggests that tissues previously thought to have limited or no ability to regenerate - nerves, skeletal muscle, heart muscle, and the lens of the eye - may have some regenerative ability. But in most cases we have not yet learned how to harness this ability for medical treatment. Dysplasia: The size, shape, or organization of mature cells becomes abnormal. This is also called atypical hyperplasia. Dysplasia is fairly common in the cells of the cervix and the lining of the respiratory tract. Neoplasia: The formation of tumors, either cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). Neoplastic cells often reproduce quickly. They may have unusual shapes and abnormal function. As you grow older, you will have changes throughout your body, including changes in your: Hormone production Immunity Skin Sleep Bones, muscles, and joints Breasts Face Reproductive system Heart and blood vessels Kidneys Lungs Nervous system Images Tissue types References Baynes JW.

Acute pancreatitis is sudden swelling and inflammation of the pancreas. Causes The pancreas is an organ located behind the stomach. It produces the hormones insulin and glucagon. It also produces chemicals called enzymes needed to digest food. Most of the time, the enzymes are active only after they reach the small intestine. If these enzymes become active inside the pancreas, they can digest the tissue of the pancreas. This causes swelling, bleeding, and damage to the organ and its blood vessels. This problem is called acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis affects men more often than women. Certain diseases, surgeries, and habits make you more likely to develop this condition. Alcohol use is responsible for up to 70% of cases in the United States. About 5 to 8 drinks per day for 5 or more years can damage the pancreas. Gallstones are the next most common cause. When the gallstones travel out of the gallbladder into the bile ducts, they may block the opening that drains bile and enzymes. The bile and enzymes "back up" into the pancreas and cause swelling. Genetics may be a factor in some cases. Sometimes, the cause is not known. Other conditions that have been linked to pancreatitis are: Autoimmune problems (when the immune system attacks the body) Damage to the bile ducts or pancreas during surgery High blood levels of a fat called triglycerides -- most often above 1,000 mg/dL Injury to the pancreas from an accident Other causes include: After certain procedures used to diagnose gallbladder and pancreas problems ( endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography , ERCP) or ultrasound guided biopsy Cystic fibrosis Overactive parathyroid gland Reye syndrome Use of certain medicines (especially estrogens, corticosteroids, sulfonamides, thiazides, and azathioprine) Certain infections, such as mumps, that involve the pancreas Symptoms The main symptom of pancreatitis is pain felt in the upper left side or middle of the abdomen. The pain : May be worse within minutes after eating or drinking at first, more commonly if foods have a high fat content Becomes constant and more severe, lasting for several days May be worse when lying flat on the back May spread (radiate) to the back or below the left shoulder blade People with acute pancreatitis often look ill and have a fever, nausea, vomiting, and sweating. Other symptoms that may occur with this disease include: Clay-colored stools Bloating and fullness Hiccups Indigestion Mild yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) Swollen abdomen Exams and Tests The health care provider will do a physical exam, which may show: Abdominal tenderness or lump (mass) Fever Low blood pressure Rapid heart rate Rapid breathing (respiratory) rate Lab tests that show the release of pancreatic enzymes will be done. These include: Increased serum amylase level Increased serum lipase level (a more specific indicator of pancreatitis than amylase levels) Increased urine amylase level Other blood tests that can help diagnose pancreatitis or its complications include: Complete blood count (CBC) Comprehensive metabolic panel The following imaging tests that can show swelling of the pancreas may be done, but are not always needed to make a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis: CT scan of the abdomen MRI of the abdomen Ultrasound of the abdomen Treatment Treatment often requires a stay in the hospital. It may involve: Pain medicines Fluids given through a vein (IV) Stopping food or fluid by mouth to limit the activity of the pancreas. In the past, patients did not get food for many days. However, feeding the digestive tract is an important treatment for pancreatitis, therefore a feeding tube may be put into the stomach or intestine until you can eat by mouth again. A tube may be inserted through the nose or mouth to remove the contents of the stomach. This may be done if vomiting and severe pain do not improve. The tube will stay in for 1 to 2 days to 1 to 2 weeks. Treating the condition that caused the problem can prevent repeated attacks. In some cases, therapy is needed to: Drain fluid that has collected in or around the pancreas Remove gallstones Relieve blockages of the pancreatic duct In the most severe cases, surgery is needed to remove damaged, dead or infected pancreatic tissue. Avoid smoking, alcoholic drinks, and fatty foods after the attack has improved. Outlook (Prognosis) Most cases go away in a week or less. However, some cases develop into a life-threatening illness. The death rate is high when: Bleeding in the pancreas has occurred. Liver, heart, or kidney problems are also present. An abscess forms the pancreas. There is death or necrosis of larger amounts of tissue in the pancreas. Sometimes the swelling and infection do not fully heal. Repeat episodes of pancreatitis may also occur. Either of these can lead to long-term damage of the pancreas (called chronic pancreatitis). Possible Complications Pancreatitis can return. The chances of it returning depend on the cause, and how well it can be treated. Complications of acute pancreatitis may include: Acute kidney failure Long-term lung damage (due to adult respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS) Buildup of fluid in the abdomen ( ascites ) Fluid collections in the pancreas (pancreatic pseudocysts) that may become infected (pancreatic abscess) Heart failure When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if: You have intense, constant abdominal pain. You develop other symptoms of acute pancreatitis. Prevention You may lower your risk of new or repeat episodes of pancreatitis by taking steps to prevent the medical conditions that can lead to the disease: DO NOT drink alcohol if it is the likely cause of the acute attack. DO NOT smoke. Tobacco smoking can worsen acute and chronic pancreatitis. Make sure children receive vaccines to protect them against mumps and other childhood illnesses. Treat medical problems that lead to high blood levels of triglycerides.

Anterior knee pain is pain that occurs at the front and center of the knee. It can be caused by many different problems, including: Chondromalacia of the patella -- the softening and breakdown of the tissue (cartilage) on the underside of the kneecap (patella) Runner's knee -- sometimes called patellar tendinitis Lateral compression syndrome -- the patella tracks more to the outside part of the knee Quadriceps tendinitis -- pain and tenderness at the quadriceps tendon attachment to the patella Patella maltracking -- instability of the patella on the knee Patella arthritis -- cartilage breakdown underneath your kneecap Causes Your kneecap (patella) sits over the front of your knee joint. As you bend or straighten your knee, the underside of the patella glides over the bones that make up the knee. Strong tendons help attach the kneecap to the bones and muscles that surround the knee. These tendons are called: The patellar tendon (where the kneecap attaches to the shin bone) The quadriceps tendon (where the thigh muscles attach to the top of the kneecap) Anterior knee pain may occur when the kneecap does not move properly and rubs against the lower part of the thigh bone. This may occur because: The kneecap is in an abnormal position (also called poor alignment of the patellofemoral joint). There is tightness or weakness of the muscles on the front and back of your thigh. You are doing too much activity that places extra stress on the kneecap (such as running, jumping or twisting, skiing, or playing soccer). Your muscles are not balanced and your core muscles maybe weaker. The groove in the thighbone where the kneecap normally rests is too shallow. You have flat feet. Your lower leg alignment is abnormal. Your core stability is weak and causes knee malalignment. Excess body weight or over activity increases the stress on your kneecap. Anterior knee pain is more common in: People who are overweight People who have had a dislocation, fracture, or other injury to the kneecap Runners, jumpers, skiers, bicyclists, and soccer players who exercise often Teenagers and healthy young adults, more often girls Other possible causes of anterior knee pain include: Arthritis Pinching of the inner lining of the knee during movement (called synovial impingement or plica syndrome) Symptoms Anterior knee pain is a dull, aching pain that is most often felt in one or more location: Behind the kneecap (patella) Below the kneecap On the sides of the kneecap One common symptom is a grating or grinding feeling when the knee is flexed (when the ankle is brought closer to the back of the thigh). Symptoms may be more noticeable with: Deep knee bends Going down stairs Running downhill Standing up from a squatting position or after sitting for a while Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. The knee may be tender and mildly swollen. Also, the kneecap may not be perfectly lined up with the thigh bone (femur). When you flex your knee, you may feel a grinding feeling below the kneecap. Pressing the kneecap when the knee is straightening out may be painful. Your provider may want you to do a single leg squat to look at muscle imbalance and your core stability. X-rays are very often normal. However, a special x-ray view of the kneecap may show signs of arthritis or tilting. MRI scans are rarely needed. Treatment Resting the knee for a short period of time and taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin may help relieve pain. Other things you can do to relieve anterior knee pain include: Change the way you exercise. Learn exercises to both strengthen and stretch the quadriceps and hamstring muscles. Learn exercises to strengthen your core. Lose weight (if you are overweight). Use special shoe inserts and support devices (orthotics) if you have flat feet. Tape your knee to realign the kneecap. Wear the correct running or sports shoes. Taping of your kneecap to improve tracking. Rarely, surgery for pain behind the kneecap is needed. During the surgery: Kneecap cartilage that has been damaged may be removed. Changes may be made to the tendons to help the kneecap move more evenly. Kneecap may be realigned to allow for better joint movement. Outlook (Prognosis) Anterior knee pain often improves with a change in activity, exercise therapy, and the use of NSAIDs. Surgery is rarely needed. However, if your knee has symptoms like instability or swelling, then you should see your provider earlier. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have symptoms of this disorder.

An ankle fracture is a break in 1 or more ankle bones. These fractures may: Be partial (the bone is only partially cracked, not all the way through) Be complete (the bone is broken through and is in 2 parts) Occur on one or both sides of the ankle Occur where the ligament was injured or torn More About Your Injury Some ankle fractures may require surgery when: The ends of the bone are out of line with each other (displaced). The fracture extends into the ankle joint (intra-articular fracture). Tendons or ligaments (tissues that hold muscles and bones together) are torn. Your provider thinks your bones may not heal properly without surgery. Your provider thinks that surgery can allow faster and more reliable healing. In children, the fracture involves the part of the ankle bone where bone is growing. When surgery is needed, it may require metal pins, screws, or plates to hold the bones in place as the fracture heals. The hardware may be temporary or permanent. What to Expect You may be referred to an orthopedic (bone) doctor. Until that visit: You will need to keep your cast or splint on at all times and keep your foot raised as much as possible. Do not put any weight on your injured ankle or try to walk on it. Without surgery, your ankle will be placed in a cast or splint for 4 to 8 weeks. The length of time you must wear a cast or splint depends on the type of fracture you have. Your cast or splint may be changed more than once, as your swelling goes down. In most cases, you will not be allowed to bear weight on your injured ankle at first. You may also wear a boot, which will allow you to put some weight on your ankle for walking. At some point, you will use a special walking boot as the healing progresses. You will need to learn: How to use crutches How to take care of your cast or splint Symptom Relief To reduce pain and swelling: Sit with your foot elevated higher than your knee at least 4 times a day Apply an ice pack 20 minutes of every hour, you are awake, for the first 2 days After 2 days, use the ice pack for 10 to 20 minutes, 3 times a day as needed For pain, you can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, and others) or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn, and others). You can buy these medicines without a prescription. Remember to: Not use these medicines for the first 24 hours after your injury. They may increase the risk of bleeding. Talk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past. Not take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or more than your provider advises you to take. Not give aspirin to children. Check with your provider about taking anti-inflammatory medicines like Ibuprofen or Naprosyn after fracture. Sometimes, they will not want you to take the medicines as it can affect healing. Acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) is a pain medicine that is safe for most people. If you have liver disease, ask your provider if this medicine is safe for you. You may need prescription pain medicines (opioids or narcotics) to keep your pain under control at first. Activity Your provider will tell you when it is OK to place any weight on your injured ankle. Most of the time, this will be at least 6 to 10 weeks. Putting weight on your ankle too soon may mean the bones do not heal properly. You may need to have your duties at work changed if your job requires walking, standing, or climbing stairs. At a certain point, you will be switched to a weight-bearing cast or splint. This will allow you to start walking. When you start walking again: Your muscles will likely be weaker and smaller, and your foot will feel stiff. You will begin learning exercises to help you rebuild your strength. You may be referred to a physical therapist to help with this process. You will need to have full strength in your calf muscle and full range of motion back in your ankle before returning to sports or work activities . Follow-up Your provider may do x-rays periodically after your injury to see how your ankle is healing. Your provider will let you know when you can return to regular activities and sports. Most people need at least 6 to 10 weeks to fully heal. When to Call the Doctor Call your provider if: Your cast or splint is damaged. Your cast or splint is too loose or too tight. You have severe pain. Your foot or leg is swollen above or below your cast or splint. You have numbness, tingling, or coldness in your foot, or your toes look dark. You cannot move your toes. You have increased swelling in your calf and foot. You have shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Also call your provider if you have questions about your injury or your recovery.

Angina is a type of chest discomfort due to poor blood flow through the blood vessels of the heart muscle. This article discusses how to care for yourself when you have angina. Signs and Symptoms of Angina You may feel pressure, squeezing, burning, or tightness in your chest. You may also have pressure, squeezing, burning, or tightness in your arms, shoulders, neck, jaw, throat, or back. Some people may have different symptoms, including shortness of breath, fatigue, weakness, and back, arm, or neck pain. This applies particularly to women, older people, and people with diabetes. You may also have indigestion or be sick to your stomach. You may feel tired. You may be short of breath, sweaty, lightheaded, or weak. Some people have angina when they are exposed to cold weather. People also may feel it during physical activity. Examples are climbing stairs, walking uphill, lifting something heavy, or having sex. How to Treat Your Chest Pain Sit, stay calm, and rest. Your symptoms will often go away soon after you stop activity. If you are lying down, sit up in bed. Try deep breathing to help with stress or anxiety. If you do not have nitroglycerin and your symptoms are not gone after resting, call 911 or the local emergency number right away. Your health care provider may have prescribed nitroglycerin tablets or spray for severe attacks. Sit or lie down when you use your tablets or spray. When using your tablet, place the pill between your cheek and gum. You can also put it under your tongue. Allow it to dissolve. Do not swallow it. When using your spray, do not shake the container. Hold the container close to your open mouth. Spray the medicine onto or under your tongue. Do not inhale or swallow the medicine. Wait for 5 minutes after the first dose of nitroglycerin. If your symptoms are not better, are worse, or return after going away, call 911 or the local emergency number right away. The operator who answers will give you further advice about what to do. (Note: your provider may have given you different advice about taking nitroglycerin when you have chest pain or pressure. Some people will be told to try 3 nitroglycerin doses 5 minutes apart before calling 911 or the local emergency number. In this case, follow your provider's instructions). Do not smoke, eat, or drink for 5 to 10 minutes after taking nitroglycerin. If you do smoke, you should try to quit. Your provider can help. Know Your Risk Factors After your symptoms have gone away, write down a few details about the event. Write down: What time of day the event took place What you were doing at the time How long the pain lasted What the pain felt like What you did to relieve your pain Ask yourself some questions: Did you take all of your regular heart medicines the right way before you had symptoms? Were you more active than normal? Did you just have a large meal? Share this information with your provider at your regular visits. Try not to do activities that strain your heart. Your provider may prescribe medicine for you to take before an activity. This can prevent symptoms. When to Call the Doctor Call 911 or the local emergency number if your angina pain: Is not better 5 minutes after taking nitroglycerin Does not go away after 3 doses of the medicine (or as directed by your provider) Is getting worse Returns after the medicine had helped Also contact your provider if: You are having symptoms more often. You are having angina when you are sitting quietly or are not active. This is called rest angina. You are feeling tired more often. You are feeling faint or lightheaded. Your heart is beating very slowly (less than 60 beats a minute) or very fast (more than 120 beats a minute), or it is not steady. You are having trouble taking your heart medicines. You have any other unusual symptoms.

Asthma is a disease that causes the airways to swell and get narrow. It leads to wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. Causes Asthma is caused by swelling (inflammation) in the airways. During an asthma attack, the muscles surrounding the airways tighten. The lining of the air passages swells. As a result, less air is able to pass through. Asthma is often seen in children. It is a leading cause of missed school days and hospital visits for children. An allergic reaction is a key part of asthma in children. Asthma and allergies often occur together. In children who have sensitive airways, asthma symptoms can be triggered by breathing in substances called allergens , or triggers . Common asthma triggers include: Animals (hair or dander) Dust, mold, and pollen Aspirin and other medicines Changes in weather (most often cold weather) Chemicals in the air or in food Tobacco smoke Exercise Strong emotions Viral infections, such as the common cold Symptoms Breathing problems are common. They can include: Shortness of breath Feeling out of breath Gasping for air Trouble breathing out (exhaling) Breathing faster than normal When your child is having a hard time breathing, the skin of the chest and neck may suck inward. Other symptoms of asthma in children include: Coughing that sometimes wakes the child up at night (it may be the only symptom). Dark bags under the eyes. Feeling tired. Irritability. Tightness in the chest. A whistling sound made when breathing ( wheezing ). You may notice it more when your child breathes out. Your child's asthma symptoms may vary. Symptoms may appear often or develop only when triggers are present. Some children are more likely to have asthma symptoms at night. Exams and Tests Your health care provider will use a stethoscope to listen to your child's lungs. The provider may be able to hear asthma sounds. However, lung sounds are often normal when your child is not having an asthma attack . The provider will have your child breathe into a device called a peak flow meter . Peak flow meters can tell how well the child can blow air out of the lungs. If the airways are narrow due to asthma, peak flow values drop. You and your child will learn to measure peak flow at home. Your child's provider may order the following tests: Allergy testing on the skin , or a blood test to see if your child is allergic to certain substances Chest x-ray Lung function tests Treatment You and your child's providers should work together as a team to create and carry out an asthma action plan. This plan will tell you how to: Avoid asthma triggers Monitor symptoms Measure peak flow Take medicines The plan should also tell you when to call the provider. It is important to know what questions to ask your child's provider . Children with asthma may need a lot of support at school . Give the school staff your asthma action plan so they know how to take care of your child's asthma. Find out how to let your child take medicine during school hours. (You may need to sign a consent form.) Having asthma does not mean your child cannot exercise. Coaches, gym teachers, and your child should know what to do if your child has asthma symptoms caused by exercise . ASTHMA MEDICINES There are two basic kinds of medicine used to treat asthma. Long-term control medicines are taken every day to prevent asthma symptoms. Your child should take these medicines even if no symptoms are present. Some children may need more than one long-term control medicine. Types of long-term control medicines include: Inhaled steroids (these are usually the first choice of treatment) Long-acting bronchodilators (these are almost always used with inhaled steroids) Leukotriene inhibitors Cromolyn sodium Quick relief or rescue asthma medicines work fast to control asthma symptoms. Children take them when they are coughing, wheezing, having trouble breathing, or having an asthma attack. Some of your child's asthma medicines can be taken using an inhaler . Children who use an inhaler should use a spacer device . This helps them get the medicine into the lungs properly. If your child uses the inhaler the wrong way, less medicine gets into the lungs. Have your provider show your child how to correctly use an inhaler. Younger children can use a nebulizer instead of an inhaler to take their medicine. A nebulizer turns asthma medicine into a mist. GETTING RID OF TRIGGERS It is important to know your child's asthma triggers. Avoiding them is the first step toward helping your child feel better. Keep pets outdoors, or at least away from the child's bedroom. No one should smoke in a house or around a child with asthma. Getting rid of tobacco smoke in the home is the single most important thing a family can do to help a child with asthma. Smoking outside the house is not enough. Family members and visitors who smoke carry the smoke inside on their clothes and hair. This can trigger asthma symptoms. Do not use indoor fireplaces. Keep the house clean. Keep food in containers and out of bedrooms. This helps reduce the possibility of cockroaches, which can trigger asthma attacks. Cleaning products in the home should be unscented. MONITOR YOUR CHILD'S ASTHMA Checking peak flow is one of the best ways to control asthma. It can help you keep your child's asthma from getting worse. Asthma attacks usually do not happen without warning. Children under age 5 may not be able to use a peak flow meter well enough for it to be helpful. However, a child should start using the peak flow meter at a young age to get used to it. An adult should always watch for a child's asthma symptoms. Outlook (Prognosis) With proper treatment, most children with asthma can live a normal life. When asthma is not well controlled, it can lead to missed school, problems playing sports, missed work for parents, and many visits to the provider's office and emergency room. Asthma symptoms often lessen or go away completely as the child gets older. Asthma that is not well controlled can lead to lasting lung problems. In rare cases, asthma is a life-threatening disease. Families need to work closely with their providers to develop a plan to care for a child with asthma. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your child's provider if you think your child has new symptoms of asthma. If your child has been diagnosed with asthma, call the provider: After an emergency room visit When peak flow numbers have been getting lower When symptoms get more frequent and more severe, even though your child is following the asthma action plan If your child is having trouble breathing or having an asthma attack, get medical help right away. Emergency symptoms include: Difficulty breathing Bluish color to the lips and face Severe anxiety due to shortness of breath Rapid pulse Sweating Decreased level of alertness, such as severe drowsiness or confusion A child who is having a severe asthma attack may need to stay in the hospital and get oxygen and medicines through a vein (intravenous line or IV).

Blood flows out of your heart and into a large blood vessel called the aorta. The aortic valve separates the heart and aorta. The aortic valve opens so blood can flow out. It then closes to keep blood from returning to the heart. You may need aortic valve surgery to replace the aortic valve in your heart if: Your aortic valve does not close all the way, so blood leaks back into the heart. This is called aortic regurgitation. Your aortic valve does not open fully, so blood flow out of the heart is reduced. This is called aortic stenosis. The aortic valve can be replaced using: Minimally invasive aortic valve surgery, done using one or more small cuts Open aortic valve surgery , done by making a large cut in your chest Description Before your surgery, you will receive general anesthesia . You will be asleep and pain-free. There are several ways to do minimally invasive aortic valve surgery. Techniques include min-thoracotomy, min-sternotomy, robot-assisted surgery, and percutaneous surgery. To perform the different procedures: Your surgeon may make a 2-inch to 3-inch (5 to 7.6 centimeters) cut in the right part of your chest near the sternum (breastbone). The muscles in the area will be divided. This lets the surgeon reach the heart and aortic valve. Your surgeon may split only the upper portion of your breast bone, allowing exposure to the aortic valve. For robotically-assisted valve surgery, the surgeon makes 2 to 4 tiny cuts in your chest. The surgeon uses a special computer to control robotic arms during the surgery. A 3D view of the heart and aortic valve are displayed on a computer in the operating room. You may need to be on a heart-lung machine for all of these surgeries. When the aortic valve is too damaged for repair, a new valve is put in place. Your surgeon will remove your aortic valve and sew a new one into place. There are two main types of new valves: Mechanical, made of man-made materials, such as titanium or carbon. These valves last the longest. You will need to take blood-thinning medicine, such as warfarin (Coumadin), for the rest of your life if you have this type of valve. Biological, made of human or animal tissue. These valves last 10 to 20 years, but you may not need to take blood thinners for life. Another technique is transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) . TAVR can be done through a small incision made in the groin or the left chest. The replacement valve is passed into the blood vessel or the heart and moved up to the aortic valve. The catheter has a balloon on the end. The balloon is inflated to stretch the opening of the valve. This procedure is called percutaneous valvuloplasty and allows for a new valve to be placed in this spot. The surgeon then sends a catheter with an attached valve and detaches the valve to take the place of the damaged aortic valve. A biological valve is used for TAVR. You do not need to be on a heart-lung machine for this procedure. In some cases, you will have coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), or surgery to replace part of the aorta at the same time. Once the new valve is working, your surgeon will: Close the small cut to your heart or aorta Place catheters (flexible tubes) around your heart to drain fluids that build up Close the surgical cut in your muscles and skin The surgery can take 3 to 6 hours, however, a TAVR procedure is often shorter. Why the Procedure is Performed Aortic valve surgery is done when the valve does not work properly. Surgery may be done for these reasons: Changes in your aortic valve are causing major heart symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting spells, or heart failure. Tests show that changes in your aortic valve are harming the work of your heart. Damage to your heart valve from infection ( endocarditis ). A minimally invasive procedure can have many benefits. There is less pain, blood loss, and risk for infection. You will also recover faster than you would from open heart surgery. Percutaneous valvuloplasty and catheter-based valve replacement such as TAVR are done only in people who are too sick or at very high risk for major heart surgery. The results of percutaneous valvuloplasty are not long-lasting. Risks Risks of any surgery are: Bleeding Blood clots in the legs that may travel to the lungs Breathing problems Infection, including in the lungs, kidneys, bladder, chest, or heart valves Reactions to medicines Other risks vary by the person's age. Some of these risks are: Damage to other organs, nerves, or bones Heart attack, stroke , or death Infection of the new valve Kidney failure Irregular heartbeat that must be treated with medicines or a pacemaker Poor healing of incision Death Before the Procedure Always tell your health care provider: If you are or could be pregnant What medicines you are taking, even drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription You may be able to store blood in the blood bank for transfusions during and after your surgery. Ask your provider about how you and your family members can donate blood. For the week before surgery, you may be asked to stop taking medicines that make it harder for your blood to clot. These might cause increased bleeding during the surgery. Some of them are aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). If you are taking warfarin (Coumadin), clopidogrel (Plavix), or other blood thinning medicine, talk with your surgeon before stopping or changing how you take these drugs. During the days before your surgery: Ask which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery. If you smoke, you must stop. Ask your provider for help. Always let your provider know if you have a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or any other illness in the time leading up to your surgery. Prepare your house for when you get home from the hospital. Shower and wash your hair the day before surgery. You may need to wash your body below your neck with a special soap. Scrub your chest 2 or 3 times with this soap. You also may be asked to take an antibiotic to prevent infection. On the day of your surgery: You may be asked not to drink or eat anything after midnight the night before your surgery. This includes using chewing gum and mints. Rinse your mouth with water if it feels dry. Be careful not to swallow. Take the medicines you have been told to take with a small sip of water. You will be told when to arrive at the hospital. After the Procedure After your operation, you will spend 3 to 7 days in the hospital. You will spend the first night in an intensive care unit (ICU). Nurses will monitor your condition at all times. Most of the time, you will be moved to a regular room or a transitional care unit in the hospital within 24 hours. You will start activity slowly. You may begin a program to make your heart and body stronger. You may have two or three tubes in your chest to drain fluid from around your heart. Most of the time, these are taken out 1 to 3 days after surgery. You may have a catheter (flexible tube) in your bladder to drain urine. You may also have intravenous (IV) lines for fluids. Nurses will closely watch monitors that display your vital signs (pulse, temperature, and breathing). You may have daily blood tests and ECGs to test your heart function until you are well enough to go home. A temporary pacemaker may be placed in your heart if your heart rhythm becomes too slow after surgery. Once you are home, recovery takes time. Take it easy, and be patient with yourself. Outlook (Prognosis) Mechanical heart valves do not fail often. However, blood clots can develop on them. If a blood clot forms, you may have a stroke. Bleeding can occur, but this is rare. Biological valves have a lower risk for blood clots, but tend to fail over time. Minimally invasive heart valve surgery has improved in recent years. These techniques are safe for most people and can reduce recovery time and pain. For best results, choose to have your aortic valve surgery at a center that does many of these procedures.

An aneurysm is a weak area in the wall of a blood vessel that causes the blood vessel to bulge or balloon out. When an aneurysm occurs in a blood vessel of the brain, it is called an intracranial aneurysm. These usually occur in the part of the brain called the cerebrum and are called a cerebral aneurysm. Causes Aneurysms in the brain occur when there is a weakened area in the wall of a blood vessel. An aneurysm may be present from birth (congenital). Or, it may develop later in life. There are many types of brain aneurysms. The most common type is called a berry aneurysm. This type can vary in size from a few millimeters to over a centimeter. Giant berry aneurysms can be bigger than 2.5 centimeters. These are more common in adults. Berry aneurysms, especially when there is more than one, are sometimes passed down through families. Watch this video about: Cerebral aneurysm Other types of cerebral aneurysms involve widening of an entire blood vessel. Or, they may appear as a ballooning out of part of a blood vessel. Such aneurysms can occur in any blood vessel that supplies the brain. Hardening of arteries ( atherosclerosis ), trauma, and infection can all injure the blood vessel wall and cause cerebral aneurysms. Brain aneurysms are relatively common. One in fifty people has a brain aneurysm, but only a small number of these aneurysms cause symptoms or rupture. Risk factors include: Family history of cerebral aneurysms Medical problems such as polycystic kidney disease , coarctation of the aorta , and endocarditis High blood pressure, smoking, alcohol, and cocaine or amphetamine drug use Symptoms A person may have an aneurysm without having any symptoms. This kind of aneurysm may be found when an MRI or CT scan of the brain is done for another reason. A brain aneurysm may begin to leak a small amount of blood. This may cause a severe headache that a person may describe as "the worst headache of my life." It may be called a thunderclap or sentinel headache. This means the headache could be a warning sign of a future rupture that may occur days to weeks after the headache first started. Symptoms may also occur if the aneurysm pushes on nearby structures in the brain or breaks open (ruptures) and causes bleeding into the brain. Symptoms depend on the location of the aneurysm, whether it breaks open, and what part of the brain it is pushing on. Symptoms may include: Double vision Loss of vision Headaches Eye pain Neck pain Stiff neck Ringing in the ears A sudden, severe headache is one symptom of an aneurysm that has ruptured. Other symptoms of an aneurysm rupture may include: Confusion, no energy , sleepiness , stupor , or coma Eyelid drooping Headaches with nausea or vomiting Muscle weakness or difficulty moving any part of the body Numbness or decreased sensation in any part of the body Problems speaking Seizures Stiff neck (occasionally) Vision changes (double vision, loss of vision) Loss of consciousness NOTE: A ruptured aneurysm is a medical emergency. Call 911 or your local emergency number. Exams and Tests An eye exam may show signs of increased pressure in the brain, including swelling of the optic nerve or bleeding into the retina of the eye. A clinical exam may show abnormal eye movement, speech, strength, or sensation. The following tests may be used to diagnose an intracranial or cerebral aneurysm and determine the cause of bleeding in the brain: Cerebral angiography or spiral CT scan angiography (CTA) of the head to show the location and size of the aneurysm Spinal tap CT scan of the head Electrocardiogram (ECG) MRI of the head or MRI angiogram (MRA) Treatment Two common methods are used to repair a brain aneurysm . Clipping is done during open brain surgery (craniotomy) . Endovascular repair is most often done. It usually involves placing a very small coil and possibly a stent (called "coiling and stenting") into or around the aneurysm. This is a less invasive and most common way to treat aneurysms. Not all aneurysms need to be treated right away. Those that are very small (less than 3 mm) are less likely to break open. Your health care provider will help you decide whether or not it is safer to have surgery to block off the aneurysm before it can break open. Sometimes people are too ill to have surgery, or it may be too dangerous to treat the aneurysm because of its location. A ruptured aneurysm is an emergency that needs to be treated right away. Treatment may involve: Being admitted to the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU) Complete bed rest and activity restrictions Drainage of blood from the brain area (cerebral ventricular drainage) Medicines to prevent seizures Medicines to control headaches and blood pressure Medicines through a vein (IV) to prevent infection Once the aneurysm is repaired, treatment may be needed to prevent a stroke from a blood vessel spasm. Outlook (Prognosis) How well you do depends on many things. People who are in a deep coma after an aneurysm rupture do not do as well as those with less severe symptoms. Ruptured cerebral aneurysms are often deadly. Of those who survive, some have no permanent disability. Others have moderate to severe disability. Possible Complications Complications of aneurysm in the brain may include: Increased pressure inside the skull Hydrocephalus, which is caused by an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles of the brain Loss of movement in one or more parts of the body Loss of sensation of any part of the face or body Seizures Stroke Subarachnoid hemorrhage When to Contact a Medical Professional Go to the emergency room or call 911 or your local emergency number if you have a sudden or severe headache, especially if you also have nausea, vomiting, seizures, or any other nervous system symptom. Also call if you have a headache that is unusual for you, especially if it is severe or your worst headache ever. Prevention There is no known way to prevent a berry aneurysm from forming. Treating high blood pressure may reduce the chance that an existing aneurysm will rupture. Controlling risk factors for atherosclerosis may reduce the likelihood of some types of aneurysms. People who are known to have an aneurysm may need regular doctor visits to make sure the aneurysm is not changing size or shape. If unruptured aneurysms are discovered in time, they can be treated before causing problems or monitored with regular imaging (usually yearly). The decision to repair an unruptured cerebral aneurysm is based on the size and location of the aneurysm, and the person's age and general health.

Acne is a skin condition that causes pimples or "zits." Whiteheads (closed comedones), blackheads (open comedones), red, inflamed papules, and nodules or cysts may develop. These most often occur on the face, neck, upper trunk and upper arms. Acne occurs when tiny pores on the surface of the skin become clogged. The pores can become plugged by substances on the surface of the skin. More commonly they develop from a mixture of the natural oils of the skin and the dead cells shed from the inside of the pore. These plugs are called comedones. Acne is most common in teenagers. But anyone can get acne. Acne breakouts can be triggered by: Hormonal changes Use of oily skin or hair care products Certain medicines Sweat Humidity Diet Daily Skin Care To keep your pores from clogging and your skin from becoming too oily: Clean your skin gently with a mild, non-drying soap. It may help to use a wash with salicylic acid or benzoyl if your skin is oily and prone to acne. Remove all dirt or make up. Wash once or twice a day, and also after exercising. Avoid scrubbing or repeated, frequent skin washing. Shampoo your hair daily, if it is oily. Comb or pull your hair back to keep the hair out of your face. Avoid using rubbing alcohol or toners that are very drying to the skin. Avoid oil-based cosmetics. Acne medicines can cause skin drying or peeling. Use a moisturizer or skin cream that is water-based or "noncomedogenic" or that clearly states that is safe to use on the face and will not cause acne. Remember that products that say they are noncomedogenic might still cause acne in you personally. Therefore, avoid any product that you find makes your acne worse. A small amount of sun exposure may improve acne slightly. However, too much exposure to sun or in tanning booths increases the risk for skin cancer. Some acne medicines can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. Use sunscreen and hats regularly if you are taking these medicines. Minimizing dairy and high glycemic index foods may help decrease acne flares. To further prevent acne: Do not aggressively squeeze, scratch, pick, or rub pimples. This can lead to skin infections as well as scarring and delayed healing. Avoid wearing tight headbands, baseball caps, and other hats. Avoid touching your face. Avoid greasy cosmetics or creams. Do not leave make up on overnight. Acne Medicines If daily skin care does not clear up blemishes, try over-the-counter acne medicines that you apply to your skin. These products may contain benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, adapalene, resorcinol, or salicylic acid. They work by killing bacteria, drying up skin oils, or causing the top layer of your skin to peel. They may cause redness or peeling of the skin. If these acne medicines cause your skin to become irritated: Try using smaller amounts. A drop the size of a pea will cover the entire face. Use the medicines only every other or third day until your skin gets used to them. Wait 10 to 15 minutes after washing your face before applying these medicines. Treatments From Your Health Care Provider If pimples are still a problem after you've tried over-the-counter medicines, your health care provider may suggest: Antibiotics in the form of pills or creams that you put on your skin Prescription gels or creams containing a retinoid to help clear up the pimples Hormone pills for women whose acne is made worse by hormonal changes Isotretinoin pills for severe acne A light based procedure called photodynamic therapy Chemical peels When to Call the Doctor Contact your provider or your dermatologist if: Self-care steps and over-the-counter medicine do not help after several months. Your acne is painful (for example, you have a lot of redness around the pimples, or you have cysts). Your acne is getting worse. You develop scars as your acne clears up. Acne is causing emotional stress.

Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a heart defect. The left coronary artery (LCA), which carries blood to the heart muscle, begins from the pulmonary artery instead of the aorta. ALCAPA is present at birth (congenital) . Causes ALCAPA is a problem that occurs when the baby's heart is developing early in the pregnancy. The developing blood vessel to the heart muscle does not attach correctly. In the normal heart, the LCA originates from the aorta. It supplies oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle on the left side of the heart as well as the mitral valve (the heart valve between the upper and lower chambers of the heart on the left side). The aorta is the major blood vessel that takes oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the rest of the body. In children with ALCAPA, the LCA originates from the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery is the major blood vessel that takes oxygen-poor blood from the heart to the lungs to pick up oxygen. When this defect occurs, blood that is lacking in oxygen is carried to the heart muscle on the left side of the heart. Therefore, the heart muscle does not get enough oxygen. The tissue begins to die due to lack of oxygen. This can cause a heart attack in the baby. A condition known as "coronary steal" further damages the heart in babies with ALCAPA. The low blood pressure in the pulmonary artery causes blood from the abnormally connected LCA to flow back toward the pulmonary artery instead of toward the heart muscle. This results in less blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. This problem can also lead to a heart attack in a baby. Coronary steal develops over time in babies with ALCAPA if the condition is not treated early. Symptoms Symptoms of ALCAPA in an infant include: Crying or sweating during feeding Irritability Pale skin Poor feeding Rapid breathing Symptoms of pain or distress in the baby (often mistaken for colic) Symptoms can appear within the first 2 months of the baby's life. Exams and Tests Typically, ALCAPA is diagnosed during infancy. In rare cases, this defect is not diagnosed until someone is a child or adult. During an exam, the health care provider will likely find signs of ALCAPA, including: Abnormal heart rhythm Enlarged heart Heart murmur (rare) Rapid pulse Tests that may be ordered include: Echocardiogram , which is an ultrasound that views the heart structures and blood flow inside the heart Electrocardiogram ( ECG ), which measures the electrical activity of the heart Chest x-ray MRI , which provides a detailed image of the heart Cardiac catheterization , a procedure in which a thin tube (catheter) is placed into the heart to see blood flow and take accurate measurements of blood pressure and oxygen levels Treatment Surgery is needed to correct ALCAPA. Only one surgery is needed in most cases. However, the surgery will depend on the baby's condition and the size of the involved blood vessels. If the heart muscle supporting the mitral valve is seriously damaged from decreased oxygen, the baby may also need surgery to repair or replace the valve. The mitral valve controls blood flow between the chambers on the left side of the heart. A heart transplant can be done in case the baby's heart is severely damaged due to lack of oxygen. Medicines used include: Water pills (diuretics) Drugs that make the heart muscle pump harder (inotropic agents) Drugs that lower the workload on the heart (beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors) Outlook (Prognosis) Without treatment, most babies do not survive their first year. Children who do survive without treatment may have serious heart problems. Babies with this problem who aren't treated could die suddenly during the following years. With early treatment such as surgery, most babies do well and can expect a normal life. Routine follow-ups with a heart specialist (cardiologist) will be needed. Possible Complications Complications of ALCAPA include: Heart attack Heart failure Heart rhythm problems Permanent damage to the heart When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if your baby: Is breathing rapidly Looks very pale Seems distressed and cries often Alternative Names Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery; ALCAPA; ALCAPA syndrome; Bland-White-Garland syndrome; Congenital heart defect - ALCAPA; Birth defect - ALCAPA Images Anomalous left coronary artery References Brothers JA, Frommelt MA, Jaquiss RDB, Myerburg RJ, Fraser CD Jr, Tweddell JS.

Allergic rhinitis is a diagnosis associated with a group of symptoms affecting the nose. These symptoms occur when you breathe in something you are allergic to, such as dust, animal dander, or pollen. Symptoms can also occur when you eat a food that you are allergic to. This article focuses on allergic rhinitis due to plant pollens. This type of allergic rhinitis is commonly called hay fever or seasonal allergy. Causes An allergen is something that triggers an allergy. When a person with allergic rhinitis breathes in an allergen such as pollen, mold, animal dander, or dust, the body releases chemicals that cause allergy symptoms. Hay fever involves an allergic reaction to pollen. Plants that cause hay fever are trees, grasses, and ragweed. Their pollen is carried by the wind. Flower pollen is carried by insects and does not cause hay fever. Types of plants that cause hay fever vary from person to person and from area to area. The amount of pollen in the air can affect whether hay fever symptoms develop or not. Hot, dry, windy days are more likely to have a lot of pollen in the air. On cool, damp, rainy days, most pollen is washed to the ground. Hay fever and allergies often run in families. If both of your parents have hay fever or other allergies, you are likely to have hay fever and allergies, too. The chance is higher if your mother has allergies. Symptoms Symptoms that occur shortly after you come into contact with the substance you are allergic to may include: Itchy nose, mouth, eyes, throat, skin, or any area Problems with smell Runny nose Sneezing Watery eyes Symptoms that may develop later include: Stuffy nose (nasal congestion) Coughing Clogged ears and decreased sense of smell Sore throat Dark circles under the eyes Puffiness under the eyes Fatigue and irritability Headache Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. You will be asked whether your symptoms vary by time of day or season, and exposure to pets or other allergens. Allergy testing may reveal the pollen or other substances that trigger your symptoms. Skin testing is the most common method of allergy testing. If your provider determines you cannot have skin testing, special blood tests may help with the diagnosis. These tests, known as IgE RAST tests, can measure the levels of allergy-related substances. A blood test, called the eosinophil count, may also help diagnose allergies. Treatment LIFESTYLE AND AVOIDING ALLERGENS The best treatment is to avoid the pollens that cause your symptoms. It may be impossible to avoid all pollen. But you can often take steps to reduce your exposure . You may be prescribed medicine to treat allergic rhinitis. The medicine your provider prescribes depends on your symptoms and how severe they are. Your age and whether you have other medical conditions, such as asthma, will also be considered. For mild allergic rhinitis, a nasal wash can help remove mucus from the nose. You can buy a saline solution at a drug store or make one at home using 1 cup (240 milliliters) of distilled or boiled then cooled water, half a teaspoon (3 grams) of salt, and pinch of baking soda. Treatments for allergic rhinitis include: ANTIHISTAMINES Medicines called antihistamines work well for treating allergy symptoms. They may be used when symptoms do not happen often or do not last long. Be aware of the following: Many antihistamines taken by mouth can be bought without a prescription. Some can cause sleepiness. You should not drive or operate machines after taking this type of medicine. Others cause little or no sleepiness. Antihistamine nasal sprays work well for treating allergic rhinitis. Ask your provider if you should try these medicines first. Antihistamine eye drops can be used as needed for itchy, watery eyes. CORTICOSTEROIDS Nasal corticosteroid sprays are the most effective treatment for allergic rhinitis. They work best when used nonstop, but they can also be helpful when used for shorter periods of time. They can even help when used intermittently. Corticosteroid sprays are generally safe for children and adults. Many brands are available without a prescription. For specific brands, you may need a prescription from your provider. DECONGESTANTS Decongestants may also be helpful for reducing symptoms such as nasal stuffiness. Do not use nasal spray decongestants for more than 3 days. OTHER MEDICINES Leukotriene inhibitors are prescription medicines that block leukotrienes. These are the chemicals the body releases in response to an allergen that also trigger symptoms. These medicines can cause side effects such as anxiety or depression in some people. Speak with your provider before starting these medications if you have a history of mental health issues. ALLERGY SHOTS Allergy shots (immunotherapy) are sometimes recommended if you cannot avoid the pollen and your symptoms are hard to control. This includes regular shots of the pollen you are allergic to. Each dose is slightly larger than the dose before it, until you reach the dose that helps control your symptoms. Allergy shots may help your body adjust to the pollen that is causing the reaction. SUBLINGUAL IMMUNOTHERAPY TREATMENT (SLIT) Instead of shots, medicine put under the tongue may help for grass and ragweed allergies. Outlook (Prognosis) Most symptoms of allergic rhinitis can be treated with medicines. More severe cases need allergy shots. Some people, especially children, may outgrow an allergy as the immune system becomes less sensitive to the trigger. But once a substance such as pollen causes allergies, it often continues to have a long-term effect on the person. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider for an appointment if: You have severe hay fever symptoms Treatment that once worked for you no longer works Your symptoms do not respond to treatment Prevention You can sometimes prevent symptoms by avoiding the pollen you are allergic to. During pollen season, you should stay indoors where it is air-conditioned, if possible. Sleep with the windows closed, and drive with the windows rolled up.

If you have cancer, a clinical trial may be an option for you. A clinical trial is a study using people who agree to participate in new tests or treatments. Clinical trials help researchers know whether a new treatment works well and is safe. Trials are available for many cancers and all stages of cancer, not just advanced cancer. If you join a trial, you may get treatment that can help you. Plus, you will help others to learn more about your cancer as well as new tests or treatments. There are many things to consider before joining a trial. Learn about why you might want to enroll in a clinical trial and where to find one. What is a Clinical Trial for Cancer? Clinical trials for cancer look at ways to: Prevent cancer Screen or test for cancer Treat or manage cancer Reduce symptoms or side effects of cancer or cancer treatments A clinical trial will recruit many people to participate. During the study, each group of people will receive a different test or treatment. Some will get the new treatment being tested. Others will get standard treatment. The researchers will collect the results to see what works best. Current cancer medicines, tests, and treatments used by most health care providers have been tested through clinical trials. Why Should You Consider a Clinical Trial? The decision to join a clinical trial is a personal one. It is a decision you have to make based on your values, goals, and expectations. Plus, there are benefits and risks when you join a trial. Some of the benefits include: You may receive a new treatment that is not yet available to other people. You may receive treatment that is better than what is currently available. You will receive close attention and monitoring by your providers. You will help researchers understand your cancer and learn better ways to help other people with the same cancer. Some of the potential risks include: You may experience side effects. The new treatment may not work for you. The new treatment may not be as good as standard treatment. You may need more office visits and more tests. Your insurance may not pay for all of your costs in a clinical trial. Is It Safe? There are strict federal rules in place to protect your safety during a clinical trial. Safety guidelines (protocols) are agreed to before the study begins. These guidelines are reviewed by health experts to make sure that the study is based on good science and the risks are low. Clinical trials are also monitored during the entire study. Before you join a clinical trial, you will learn about the safety guidelines, what is expected of you, and how long the study will last. You will be asked to sign a consent form saying that you understand and agree to the way the study will be run and the potential side effects. Is There a Cost? Before you join a trial, make sure you look into which costs are covered. Routine cancer care costs are often covered by health insurance. You should review your policy and contact your health plan to make sure. Often, your health plan will cover most routine office visits and consults, as well as tests done to monitor your health. Research costs, such as the study medicine, or extra visits or tests, may need to be covered by the research sponsor. Also keep in mind that extra visits and tests may mean additional cost to you in lost work time and daycare or transportation costs. Who Can Join a Clinical Trial? Each clinical study has guidelines about who can join. These are called eligibility criteria. These guidelines are based on what questions the researchers are trying to answer. Studies often try to include people who have certain things in common. This can make it easier to understand the results. So you may be able to join only if you have cancer at a certain stage, are older or younger than a certain age, and do not have other health problems. If you are eligible, you can apply to be in the clinical trial. Once accepted, you become a volunteer. This means that you may quit at any time. But if you feel you want to quit, be sure you talk it over with your provider first. How to Find a Clinical Trial? Trials are done in many places, such as: Cancer centers Local hospitals Medical group offices Community clinics You can find clinical trials listed on the website of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) -- www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials . It is a part of the National Institutes of Health, the United States government research agency. Many of the clinical trials run across the country are sponsored by the NCI. If you are interested in joining a clinical trial, talk with your provider. Ask if there is a trial in your area related to your cancer. Your provider can help you understand the type of care you will receive and how the trial will change or add to your care. You can also go over all of the risks and benefits to decide whether joining a trial is a good move for you. Alternative Names Intervention study - cancer References American Cancer Society website.

You had chemotherapy treatment for your cancer. Your risk for infection, bleeding, and skin problems may be high. To stay healthy after chemotherapy, you'll need to take good care of yourself. This includes practicing mouth care, preventing infections, among other measures. What to Expect at Home After chemotherapy, you may have mouth sores, an upset stomach, and diarrhea. You will probably get tired easily. Your appetite may be poor, but you should be able to drink and eat. Mouth Care Take good care of your mouth. Chemotherapy can cause dry mouth or sores. This can lead to an increase in bacteria in your mouth. The bacteria can cause infection in your mouth, which can spread to other parts of your body. Brush your teeth and gums 2 to 3 times a day for 2 to 3 minutes each time. Use a toothbrush with soft bristles. Let your toothbrush air dry between brushings. Use a toothpaste with fluoride. Floss gently once a day. Rinse your mouth 4 times a day with a salt and baking soda solution. (Mix 1/8 teaspoon or 0.7 grams of salt and 1/4 teaspoon or 1.25 grams of baking soda in 8 ounces or 240 milliliters of water.) Your health care provider may prescribe a mouth rinse. Do not use mouth rinses with alcohol in them. Use your regular lip care products to keep your lips from drying and cracking. Tell your provider if you develop new mouth sores or pain. Do not eat foods and drinks that have a lot of sugar in them. Chew sugarless gums or suck on sugar-free popsicles or sugar-free hard candies. Take care of your dentures, braces, or other dental products. If you wear dentures, put them in only when you are eating. Do this for the first 3 to 4 weeks after your chemotherapy. Do not wear them at other times during the first 3 to 4 weeks. Brush your dentures 2 times a day. Rinse them well. To kill germs, soak your dentures in an antibacterial solution when you are not wearing them. Preventing Infections Take care not to get infections for up to one year or more after your chemotherapy. Practice safe eating and drinking during cancer treatment. Do not eat or drink anything that may be undercooked or spoiled. Make sure your water is safe. Know how to cook and store foods safely. Be careful when you eat out. Do not eat raw vegetables, meat, fish, or anything else you are not sure is safe. Wash your hands with soap and water often, including: After being outdoors After touching body fluids, such as mucus or blood After changing a diaper Before handling food After using the telephone After doing housework After going to the bathroom Keep your house clean. Stay away from crowds. Ask visitors who have a cold to wear a mask, or not to visit. Don't do yard work or handle flowers and plants. Be careful with pets and animals. If you have a cat, keep it inside. Have someone else change your cat's litter box every day. Don't play rough with cats. Scratches and bites can get infected. Stay away from puppies, kittens, and other very young animals. Ask your provider what vaccines you may need and when to get them. Other Self-care Other things you can do to stay healthy include: If you have a central venous line or a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line , know how to take care of it. If your provider tells you your platelet count is still low, learn how to prevent bleeding during cancer treatment . Stay active by walking. Slowly increase how far you go based on how much energy you have. Eat enough protein and calories to keep your weight up. Ask your provider about liquid food supplements that can help you get enough calories and nutrients. Be careful when you are in the sun. Wear a hat with a wide brim. Use sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher on any exposed skin. Do not smoke. Follow-up You will need close follow-up care with your cancer providers. Be sure to keep all your appointments. When to Call the Doctor Contact your provider if you have any of these symptoms: Signs of infection, such as fever, chills, or sweats Diarrhea that does not go away or is bloody Severe nausea and vomiting Inability to eat or drink Extreme weakness Redness, swelling, or drainage from any place where you have an intravenous (IV) line inserted A new skin rash or blisters Jaundice (your skin or the white part of your eyes looks yellow) Pain in your abdomen A very bad headache or one that does not go away A cough that is getting worse Trouble breathing when you are at rest or when you are doing simple tasks Burning when you urinate Alternative Names Chemotherapy - discharge; Chemotherapy - home care discharge; Chemotherapy - discharge mouth care; Chemotherapy - preventing infections discharge References Doroshow JH.

It is used when your urinary sphincter no longer works well. When you need to urinate, the cuff of the artificial sphincter can be relaxed. This allows urine to flow out. Other procedures to treat urine leakage and incontinence include: Tension-free vaginal tape (midurethral sling) and autologous sling (women) Urethral bulking with artificial material (men and women) Retropubic suspension (women) Male urethral sling (men) Description This procedure may be done while you are under: General anesthesia . You will be asleep and unable to feel pain. Spinal anesthesia . You will be awake but will not be able to feel anything below your waist. You will be given medicines to help you relax. An artificial sphincter has 3 parts: A cuff, which fits around your urethra. The urethra is the tube that carries urine from your bladder to the outside of your body. When the cuff is inflated (full), the cuff closes off your urethra to stop urine flow or leakage. A balloon, which is placed under your belly muscles. It holds the same liquid as the cuff. A pump, which relaxes the cuff by moving fluid from the cuff to the balloon. A surgical cut will be made in one of these areas so that the cuff can be put in place: Scrotum or perineum (men). Labia (women). Lower belly (men and women). In some cases, this incision may not be necessary. The pump can be placed in a man's scrotum. It can also be placed underneath the skin in a woman's lower belly or leg. Once the artificial sphincter is in place, you will use the pump to empty (deflate) the cuff. Squeezing the pump moves fluid from the cuff to the balloon. When the cuff is empty, your urethra opens so that you can urinate. The cuff will re-inflate on its own in 90 seconds. Why the Procedure is Performed Artificial urinary sphincter surgery is done to treat stress incontinence. Stress incontinence is a leakage of urine, which occurs with activities such as walking, lifting, exercising, or even coughing or sneezing. The procedure is recommended for men who have urine leakage with activity. This type of leakage can occur after prostate surgery. The artificial sphincter is advised when other treatments do not work. Women who have urine leakage most often try other treatment options before having an artificial sphincter placed. It is rarely used to treat stress urinary incontinence in women in the United States. Most of the time, your health care provider will recommend medicines and bladder retraining before surgery. Risks This procedure is most often safe. Ask your provider about the possible complications. Risks related to anesthesia and surgery in general are: Reactions to medicines Breathing problems Bleeding, blood clots Infection Risks for this surgery may include: Damage to the urethra (at the time of surgery or later), bladder, or vagina Difficulty emptying your bladder, which may require a catheter Urine leakage that may get worse Failure or wearing away of the device that requires surgery to replace or remove it Before the Procedure Always tell your provider what medicines you are taking. Also let the provider know about the over-the-counter medicines, herbs and supplements that you bought without a prescription. During the days before the surgery: You may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other drugs that make it hard for your blood to clot. Ask your provider which drugs you should still take on the day of your surgery. On the day of your surgery: You will usually be asked not to drink or eat anything for 6 to 12 hours before the surgery. Take the drugs your provider told you to take with a small sip of water. Your provider will tell you when to arrive at the hospital. Your provider will test your urine. This will make sure you do not have a urinary infection before starting your surgery. After the Procedure You may return from surgery with a urinary catheter in place. This catheter will drain urine from your bladder for a little while. It will be removed before you leave the hospital. You will not use the artificial sphincter for a while after surgery. This means you will still have urine leakage. Your body tissues need this time to heal. About 6 weeks after surgery, you will be taught how to use your pump to inflate your artificial sphincter. You will need to carry a wallet card or wear medical identification. This tells providers you have an artificial sphincter. The sphincter must be turned off if you need to have a urinary catheter placed. Women may need to change how they do some activities (such as bicycle riding), since the pump is placed in the labia. Outlook (Prognosis) Urinary leakage decreases for many people who have this procedure. However, there may still be some leakage. Over time, some or all of the leakage may come back. There may be a slow wearing away of the urethra tissue under the cuff. This tissue may become spongy. This may make the device less effective or cause it to erode into the urethra. If your incontinence comes back, changes may be made to the device to correct it. If the device erodes into the urethra, it will need to be removed.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, is a disease of the nerve cells in the brain, brain stem and spinal cord that control voluntary muscle movement. ALS is also known as Lou Gehrig disease. Causes One in 10 cases of ALS is due to a genetic defect. The cause is unknown in most other cases. In ALS, motor nerve cells (neurons) waste away or die, and can no longer send messages to muscles. This eventually leads to muscle weakening, twitching, and an inability to move the arms, legs, and body. The condition slowly gets worse. When the muscles in the chest area stop working, it becomes hard or impossible to breathe. ALS affects approximately 5 out of every 100,000 people worldwide. Having a family member who has a hereditary form of the disease is a risk factor for ALS. Other risks include military service. The reasons for this are unclear, but it may have to do with environmental exposure to toxins. Symptoms Symptoms usually do not develop until after age 50, but they can start in younger people. People with ALS have a loss of muscle strength and coordination that eventually gets worse and makes it impossible for them to do routine tasks such as going up steps, getting out of a chair, or swallowing. Weakness can first affect the arms or legs, or the ability to breathe or swallow. As the disease gets worse, more muscle groups develop problems. ALS does not affect the senses (sight, smell, taste, hearing, touch). Most people are able to think normally, although a small number develop dementia, causing problems with memory. Muscle weakness starts in one body part, such as the arm or hand, and slowly gets worse until it leads to the following: Difficulty lifting, climbing stairs, and walking Difficulty breathing Difficulty swallowing -- choking easily, drooling, or gagging Head drop due to weakness of the neck muscles Speech problems, such as a slow or abnormal speech pattern (slurring of words) Voice changes, hoarseness Other findings include: Depression Muscle cramps Muscle stiffness, called spasticity Muscle contractions , called fasciculations Weight loss Exams and Tests The health care provider will examine you and ask about your medical history and symptoms. The physical exam may show: Weakness, often beginning in one area Muscle tremors, spasms, twitching, or loss of muscle tissue Twitching of the tongue (common) Abnormal reflexes Stiff or clumsy walk Decreased or increased reflexes at the joints Difficulty controlling crying or laughing (sometimes called emotional incontinence) Loss of gag reflex Tests that may be done include: Blood tests to rule out other conditions Breathing test to see if lung muscles are affected Cervical spine CT or MRI to be sure there is no disease or injury to the neck, which can mimic ALS Electromyography to see which nerves or muscles do not work properly Genetic testing, if there is a family history of ALS Head CT or MRI to rule out other conditions Swallowing studies Spinal tap (lumbar puncture) Treatment There is no known cure for ALS. Two medicines are available that help slow the progression of symptoms and may help people live slightly longer: Riluzole (Rilutek) Edaravone (Radicava) Treatments to control other symptoms include: Baclofen or diazepam for spasticity that interferes with daily activities Trihexyphenidyl or amitriptyline for people with problems swallowing their own saliva Physical therapy, rehabilitation, use of braces or a wheelchair, or other measures may be needed to help with muscle function and general health. People with ALS tend to lose weight. The illness itself increases the need for food and calories. At the same time, problems with choking and swallowing make it hard to eat enough. To help with feeding, a tube may be placed into the stomach. A dietitian who specializes in ALS can give advice on healthy eating. Breathing devices include machines that are used only at night, and constant mechanical ventilation. Medicine for depression may be needed if a person with ALS is feeling sad. They also should discuss their wishes regarding artificial ventilation with their families and providers. Support Groups Emotional support is vital in coping with the disorder, because mental functioning is not affected. Groups such as the ALS Association may be available to help people who are coping with the disorder. Support for people who are caring for someone with ALS is also available, and may be very helpful. Outlook (Prognosis) Over time, people with ALS lose the ability to function and care for themselves. Death often occurs within 3 to 5 years of diagnosis. About 1 in 4 people survive for more than 5 years after diagnosis. Some people live much longer, but they typically need help breathing from a ventilator or other device. Possible Complications Complications of ALS include: Breathing in food or fluid ( aspiration ) Loss of ability to care for self Lung failure Pneumonia Pressure sores Weight loss When to Contact a Medical Professional Call your provider if: You have symptoms of ALS, particularly if you have a family history of the disorder You or someone else has been diagnosed with ALS and symptoms get worse or new symptoms develop Increased difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, and episodes of apnea are symptoms that require immediate attention. Prevention You may want to see a genetic counselor if you have a family history of ALS.

An allergy is an immune response or reaction to substances that are usually not harmful. Causes Allergies are very common. Both genes and environment play a role. If both your parents have allergies, there is a good chance that you have them, too. The immune system normally protects the body against harmful substances, such as bacteria and viruses. It also reacts to foreign substances called allergens . These are usually harmless and in most people do not cause a problem. In a person with allergies, the immune response is oversensitive. When it recognizes an allergen, the immune system launches a response. Chemicals such as histamines are released. These chemicals cause allergy symptoms. Watch this video about: Allergies Common allergens include: Drugs Dust Food Insect venom Mold Pet and other animal dander Pollen Some people have allergy-like reactions to hot or cold temperatures, sunlight, or other environmental triggers. Sometimes, friction (rubbing or roughly stroking the skin) will cause symptoms. Allergies may make certain medical conditions, such as sinus problems, eczema , and asthma , worse. Symptoms Mostly, the part of the body the allergen touches affects what symptoms you develop. For example: Allergens that you breathe in often cause a stuffy nose, itchy nose and throat, mucus, cough, and wheezing . Allergens that touch the eyes may cause itchy, watery, red, swollen eyes. Eating something you are allergic to can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, or a severe, life-threatening reaction. Allergens that touch the skin can cause a skin rash , hives , itching, blisters, or skin peeling. Drug allergies usually involve the whole body and can lead to a variety of symptoms. At times, an allergy can trigger a response that involves the entire body. Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions, such as when the allergy occurs. Allergy testing may be needed to find out whether the symptoms are an actual allergy or are caused by other problems. For example, eating contaminated food ( food poisoning ) may cause symptoms similar to food allergies. Some medicines (such as aspirin and ampicillin) can produce non-allergic reactions, including rashes. A runny nose or cough may actually be due to an infection. Skin testing is the most common method of allergy testing: The prick test involves placing a small amount of the suspected allergy-causing substances on the skin, and then slightly pricking the area so the substance moves under the skin. The skin is closely watched for signs of a reaction, which include swelling and redness. The intradermal test involves injecting tiny amount of allergen under your skin, then watching the skin for a reaction. Both the prick and intradermal tests are read 15 minutes after application of the test. The patch test involves placing a patch with the suspected allergen on your skin. The skin is then closely watched for signs of a reaction. This test is used to determine contact allergy. It is usually read 48 to 72 hours after application of the test. The doctor may also check your reaction to physical triggers by applying heat, cold, or other stimulation to your body and watching for an allergic response. Blood tests that may be done include: Immunoglobulin E (IgE), which measures levels of allergy-related substances Complete blood count (CBC) during which an eosinophil white blood cell count is done In some cases, the doctor may tell you to avoid certain items to see if you get better, or to use suspected items to see if you feel worse. This is called "use or elimination testing." This is often used to check for food or medicine allergies. Treatment Severe allergic reactions ( anaphylaxis ) need to be treated with a medicine called epinephrine. It can be life-saving when given right away. If you use epinephrine, call 911 or the local emergency number and go straight to the hospital. The best way to reduce symptoms is to avoid what causes your allergies. This is especially important for food and drug allergies. There are several types of medicines to prevent and treat allergies. Which medicine your doctor recommends depends on the type and severity of your symptoms, your age, and overall health. Illnesses that are caused by allergies (such as asthma, hay fever, and eczema) may need other treatments. Medicines that can be used to treat allergies include: ANTIHISTAMINES Antihistamines are available over-the-counter and by prescription. They are available in many forms, including: Capsules and pills Eye drops Injection Liquid Nasal spray CORTICOSTEROIDS These are anti-inflammatory medicines. They are available in many forms, including: Creams and ointment for the skin Eye drops Nasal spray Lung inhaler Pills Injection People with severe allergic symptoms may be prescribed corticosteroid pills or injections for short periods. DECONGESTANTS Decongestants help relieve a stuffy nose. Do not use decongestant nasal spray for more than several days because they can cause a rebound effect and make the congestion worse. Decongestants in pill form do not cause this problem. People with high blood pressure, heart problems, or prostate enlargement should use decongestants with caution. OTHER MEDICINES Leukotriene inhibitors are medicines that block the substances that trigger allergies. People with asthma and indoor and outdoor allergies may be prescribed these medicines. ALLERGY SHOTS Allergy shots ( immunotherapy ) are sometimes recommended if you cannot avoid the allergen and your symptoms are hard to control. Allergy shots keep your body from over-reacting to the allergen. You will get regular injections of the allergen. Each dose is slightly larger than the last dose until a maximum dose is reached. These shots do not work for everybody and you will have to visit the doctor often. SUBLINGUAL IMMUNOTHERAPY TREATMENT (SLIT) Instead of shots, medicine put under the tongue may help for grass, ragweed, and dust mite allergies. Support Groups Ask your provider if there are any asthma and allergy support groups in your area. Outlook (Prognosis) Most allergies can be easily treated with medicine. Some children may outgrow an allergy, especially food allergies. But once a substance has triggered an allergic reaction, it usually continues to affect the person. Allergy shots are most effective when used to treat hay fever and insect sting allergies. They are not used to treat food allergies because of the danger of a severe reaction. Allergy shots may need years of treatment, but they work in most cases. However, they may cause uncomfortable side effects (such as hives and rash) and dangerous outcomes (such as anaphylaxis). Talk with your provider whether allergy drops (SLIT) are right for you. Possible Complications Complications that may result from allergies or their treatment include: Anaphylaxis (life-threatening allergic reaction) Breathing problems and discomfort during the allergic reaction Drowsiness and other side effects of medicines When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider for an appointment if: Severe symptoms of allergy occur Treatment for allergies no longer works Prevention Breastfeeding can help prevent or decrease allergies when you feed babies this way only for 4 to 6 months. However, changing a mother's diet during pregnancy or while breastfeeding does not seem to help prevent allergies. For most children, changing the diet or using special formulas does not seem to prevent allergies. If a parent, brother, sister, or other family member has a history of eczema and allergies, discuss feeding with your child's doctor. There is also evidence that being exposed to certain allergens (such as dust mites and cat dander) in the first year of life may prevent some allergies. This is called the "hygiene hypothesis." It came from the observation that infants on farms tend to have fewer allergies than those who grow up in more sterile environments. However, older children do not seem to benefit. Once allergies have developed, treating the allergies and carefully avoiding allergy triggers can prevent reactions in the future.

Changes in posture and gait (walking pattern) are common with aging. The skeleton provides support and structure to the body. Joints are the areas where bones come together. They allow the skeleton to be flexible for movement. In a joint, bones do not directly contact each other. Instead, they are cushioned by cartilage in the joint, synovial membranes around the joint, and fluid. Muscles provide the force and strength to move the body. Coordination is directed by the brain, but is affected by changes in the muscles and joints. Changes in the muscles, joints, and bones affect the posture and walk, and lead to weakness and slowed movement. AGING CHANGES People lose bone mass or density as they age, especially women after menopause . The bones lose calcium and other minerals. The spine is made up of bones called vertebrae. Between each bone is a gel-like cushion (called a disk). With aging, the middle of the body (trunk) becomes shorter as the disks gradually lose fluid and become thinner. Vertebrae also lose some of their mineral content, making each bone thinner. The spinal column becomes curved and compressed (packed together). Bone spurs caused by aging and overall use of the spine may also form on the vertebrae. The foot arches become less pronounced, contributing to a slight loss of height. The long bones of the arms and legs are more brittle because of mineral loss, but they do not change length. This makes the arms and legs look longer when compared with the shortened trunk. The joints become stiffer and less flexible. Fluid in the joints may decrease. The cartilage may begin to rub together and wear away. Minerals may deposit in and around some joints (calcification). This is common around the shoulder. Hip and knee joints may begin to lose cartilage (degenerative changes). The finger joints lose cartilage and the bones thicken slightly. Finger joint changes, most often bony swelling called osteophytes, are more common in women. These changes may be inherited. Lean body mass decreases. This decrease is partly caused by a loss of muscle tissue ( atrophy ). The speed and amount of muscle changes seem to be caused by genes. Muscle changes often begin in the 20s in men and in the 40s in women. Lipofuscin (an age-related pigment) and fat are deposited in muscle tissue. The muscle fibers shrink. Muscle tissue is replaced more slowly. Lost muscle tissue may be replaced with a tough fibrous tissue. This is most noticeable in the hands, which may look thin and bony. Muscles are less toned and less able to contract because of changes in the muscle tissue and normal aging changes in the nervous system . Muscles may become rigid with age and may lose tone, even with regular exercise. EFFECT OF CHANGES Bones become more brittle and may break more easily. Overall height decreases, mainly because the trunk and spine shorten. Breakdown of the joints may lead to inflammation, pain, stiffness, and deformity. Joint changes affect almost all older people. These changes range from minor stiffness to severe arthritis . The posture may become more stooped (bent). The knees and hips may become more flexed. The neck may tilt, and the shoulders may narrow while the pelvis becomes wider. Movement slows and may become limited. The walking pattern (gait) becomes slower and shorter. Walking may become unsteady, and there is less arm swinging. Older people get tired more easily and have less energy. Strength and endurance change. Loss of muscle mass reduces strength. COMMON PROBLEMS Osteoporosis is a common problem, especially for older women. Bones break more easily. Compression fractures of the vertebrae can cause pain and reduce mobility. Muscle weakness contributes to fatigue, weakness, and reduced activity tolerance. Joint problems ranging from mild stiffness to debilitating arthritis ( osteoarthritis ) are very common. The risk of injury increases because gait changes , instability, and loss of balance may lead to falls. Some older people have reduced reflexes. This is most often caused by changes in the muscles and tendons, rather than changes in the nerves. Decreased knee jerk or ankle jerk reflexes can occur. Some changes, such as a positive Babinski reflex , are not a normal part of aging. Involuntary movements (muscle tremors and fine movements called fasciculations ) are more common in the older people. Older people who are not active may have weakness or abnormal sensations ( paresthesias ). People who are unable to move on their own, or who do not stretch their muscles with exercise, may get muscle contractures. PREVENTION Exercise is one of the best ways to slow or prevent problems with the muscles, joints, and bones. A moderate exercise program can help you maintain strength, balance, and flexibility. Exercise helps the bones stay strong. Talk to your health care provider before starting a new exercise program. It is important to eat a well-balanced diet with plenty of calcium. Women need to be particularly careful to get enough calcium and vitamin D as they age. Postmenopausal women and men over age 70 should take in 1,200 mg of calcium per day. Women and men over age 70 should get 800 international units (IU) of vitamin D daily. If you have osteoporosis, talk to your provider about prescription treatments.

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic form of arthritis. It mostly affects the bones and joints at the base of the spine where it connects with the pelvis. These joints can become swollen and inflamed. Over time, the affected spinal bones may join together. Causes AS is the main member of a family of similar forms of arthritis called spondyloarthritis. Other members include psoriatic arthritis, arthritis of inflammatory bowel disease and reactive arthritis. This family of arthritis affects up to 1 in 100 people. The cause of AS is unknown, however genes seem to play a role. The majority of people with AS are positive for the HLA-B27 gene, but not everyone who has this gene has AS. The disease often begins between ages 20 and 40, but it may begin before age 10. It affects more males than females. Symptoms AS starts with lower back pain that comes and goes but usually becomes present most of the time as the condition progresses. Pain and stiffness are worse at night, in the morning, or when you are less active. The discomfort may wake you from sleep. The pain often gets better with activity or exercise. Back pain may begin in the joint between the pelvis and spine (sacroiliac joints). Over time, it may involve all or part of the spine. Your lower spine may become less flexible. Over time, you may stand in a hunched forward position. Other parts of your body that may be affected include: The joints of the shoulders, knees and ankles, which may be swollen and painful The joints between your ribs and breastbone, so that you cannot expand your chest fully The eye, which may have swelling and redness called uveitis Fatigue is also a common symptom. Less common symptoms include: Slight fever AS may occur with other conditions, such as: Psoriasis Ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease Recurring or chronic eye inflammation (iritis , uveitis) Exams and Tests Tests may include: Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody (which should be negative) Complete blood count (CBC) ESR (a measure of inflammation) HLA-B27 antigen (which detects the gene linked to ankylosing spondylitis) Rheumatoid factor (which should be negative) X-rays of the spine and pelvis MRI of the spine and pelvis Treatment Your health care provider may prescribe medicines such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce swelling and pain. Some NSAIDs can be bought over-the-counter (OTC). These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). Other NSAIDs are prescribed by your provider. Talk to your provider or pharmacist before daily long-term use of any over-the-counter NSAID. You may also need stronger medicines to control pain and swelling, such as: Corticosteroid therapy (such as prednisone) used for short periods of time Sulfasalazine A biologic tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor (such as etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab, certolizumab or golimumab) A biologic inhibitor of IL17A, secukinumab Surgery, such as hip replacement, may be done if pain or joint damage is severe. Exercises can help improve posture and breathing. Lying flat on your back at night can help you keep a normal posture. Outlook (Prognosis) The course of the disease is hard to predict. Over time, signs and symptoms of AS flareup (relapse) and quiet down (remission). Most people are able to function well unless they have a lot of damage to the hips or the spine. Joining a support group of others with the same problem may often help. Treatment with NSAIDs often reduces the pain and swelling. Treatments given by IV or injection such as TNF inhibitors early in the disease appears to slow progression of the spine arthritis. Other newer drugs such as Interleukin-17 inhibitors and oral medicines, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have been approved as well. Rarely, people with ankylosing spondylitis may have problems with: Psoriasis, a chronic skin disorder Inflammation in the eye (uveitis) Inflammation in the intestine ( colitis ) Abnormal heart rhythm Scarring or thickening of the lung tissue Scarring or thickening of the aortic heart valve Spinal cord injury after a fall When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if: You have symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis You have ankylosing spondylitis and develop new symptoms during treatment Alternative Names Spondylitis; Spondyloarthritis; HLA - B27 Images Skeletal spine Cervical spondylosis References Gardocki RJ, Park AL.

Acute myeloid leukemia is a cancer of the white blood cells within the blood and bone marrow. Bone marrow is the soft tissue inside bones that generates all blood components including white blood cells. "Acute" means the cancer develops quickly and "myeloid" is the type of white cells that become cancerous. Both adults and children can get acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This article is about AML in children. Causes In children, AML is rare. AML involves cells in the bone marrow that usually become white blood cells. These leukemia cells build up in the bone marrow and blood, leaving no space for healthy red and white blood cells and platelets to form. Because there are not enough healthy cells to do their jobs, children with AML are more likely to have: Anemia (low level of red blood cells) Increased risk for bleeding and bruising Infections Most of the time, what causes AML is unknown. In children, some things can increase the risk of developing AML: Exposure to alcohol or tobacco smoke before birth A history of certain diseases, such as aplastic anemia Certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome , neurofibromatosis , and other rare syndromes Previous use of certain chemotherapy drugs such as cyclophosphamide Past treatment with radiation therapy Having one or more risk factor does not mean your child will develop cancer. Most children who develop AML have no known risk factors. Symptoms Symptoms of AML include: Feeling weak or tired Bone or joint pain Frequent infections Easy bleeding or bruising Fever with or without an infection Night sweats Painless lumps in the neck, armpits, stomach, groin, or other parts of the body that may be blue or purple Pinpoint spots (petechiae) under the skin caused by bleeding Shortness of breath Loss of appetite and eating less food Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform the following exams and tests: Physical exam and health history Complete blood count (CBC) and other blood tests Blood chemistry study Chest x-ray Biopsies of the bone marrow , or lymph node A test to look for changes in the chromosomes in blood or bone marrow Other tests may be done to determine the specific type of AML. Treatment Treatment for children with AML may include: Anticancer drugs ( chemotherapy ) Certain types of targeted therapy Bone marrow transplant is used if the leukemia returns after treatment or doesn't respond well to initial therapy with chemotherapy. The process uses high doses of chemotherapy and sometimes radiation therapy and transfusion of bone marrow from a compatible donor. Supportive care includes red blood cell and platelets (cells that help to stop bleeding) transfusions. Your child's treatment team will explain the different options to you. You will want to take notes. Be sure to ask questions if you don't understand something. Support Groups Having a child with cancer can make you feel very alone. In a cancer support group, you can find people who are going through the same things you are. They can help you cope with your feelings. They can also help you find help or solutions for problems. Ask your health care team or staff at the cancer center to help you find a support group. Outlook (Prognosis) Cancer can come back at any time. But for most children, AML doesn't come back after being gone for 5 years. However, there is a wide range in outcomes for different subtypes of AML, and the disease might return. Possible Complications The leukemia cells can affect various organs in the body including: Brain Kidneys Lungs Skin Intestines As a result of the treatment, it's common to experience: Fatigue Hair loss Weight loss Mouth sores Need for transfusions Infections requiring hospitalization Severe organ damage (very rarely) When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider for an appointment right away if your child develops these symptoms: Persistent fever Easy bruising Shortness of breath Viral infection that doesn't resolve Prolonged fatigue Any other symptoms of AML Prevention Many childhood cancers can't be prevented. Most children who develop leukemia have no risk factors.

Automatic dishwasher soap poisoning refers to illness that occurs when you swallow soap used in automatic dishwashers or when the soap contacts the face. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. Poisonous Ingredient Automatic dishwasher products contain various soaps. Potassium carbonate and sodium carbonate are the most common. Standard liquid household detergents and soaps rarely cause serious injury if swallowed accidentally. However, single-use laundry or dishwasher detergent packets, or "pods" are more concentrated. Therefore, they are more likely to damage the esophagus. Where Found The poisonous ingredients are found in automatic dishwasher soaps. Symptoms Symptoms of automatic dishwasher soap poisoning can affect many parts of the body. EYES, EARS, NOSE, AND THROAT Severe pain in the throat Severe pain or burning in the nose, eyes, ears, lips, or tongue Loss of vision Throat swelling (which may also cause breathing trouble) HEART AND BLOOD CIRCULATION Low blood pressure - develops quickly Collapse Severe change in blood acid levels, which can lead to organ damage LUNGS Breathing difficulty (from breathing in the poison) SKIN Irritation Burns Necrosis (tissue death) in the skin or tissues underneath STOMACH AND INTESTINES Severe abdominal pain Vomiting, may be bloody Burns of the esophagus (food pipe) Blood in the stool Home Care Seek immediate emergency medical help. DO NOT make the person throw up. If the soap is in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes. If the soap was swallowed, have the person immediately drink water or milk. Before Calling Emergency Determine the following information: The person's age, weight, and condition The name of the product (ingredients and strengths, if known) The time it was swallowed The amount swallowed Poison Control Your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible. What to Expect at the Emergency Room The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Blood and urine tests will be done. Symptoms will be treated as needed. The person may receive: Activated charcoal to help prevent the remaining poison from being absorbed into the stomach and digestive tract. Airway and breathing support, including oxygen. In extreme cases, a tube may be passed through the mouth into the lungs to prevent aspiration. A breathing tube (ventilator) would then be needed. Blood transfusion if severe blood loss has occurred. Chest x-ray . ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing). Fluids through a vein (IV). Endoscopy -- a camera down the throat to see burns in the esophagus and stomach. Medicines (laxatives) to move the poison quickly through the body. Tube through the mouth into the stomach to wash out the stomach ( gastric lavage ). This is rare. Medicines to treat symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting, or those of an allergic reaction, such as swelling of the face or mouth or wheezing (diphenhydramine, epinephrine, or steroids). Outlook (Prognosis) Most cases of swallowing dishwasher soap are not that harmful. How well a person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment was received. The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery. Swallowing poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Damage can continue to occur to the esophagus and stomach for several weeks after the product is swallowed. Death may occur up to a month after the poisoning.

An aneurysm is an abnormal widening or ballooning of a part of an artery due to weakness in the wall of the blood vessel. Causes It is not clear exactly what causes aneurysms. Some aneurysms are present at birth (congenital). Defects in some parts of the artery wall may be a cause. Common locations for aneurysms include: Major artery from the heart such as the thoracic or abdominal aorta Brain ( cerebral aneurysm ) Behind the knee (popliteal artery aneurysm) Intestine (mesenteric artery aneurysm) Artery in the spleen (splenic artery aneurysm) Certain factors or conditions may increase the risk for aneurysms including: High blood pressure (thoracic, abdominal and cerebral aneurysms) High cholesterol Cigarette smoking Illicit drug use (cocaine, amphetamines) Pregnancy (often linked to splenic artery aneurysms) Family history (sibling, parent, or child) Inherited disorders that may increase the risk include: Fibromuscular dysplasia (abnormal cell growth in artery walls) Polycystic kidney disease Coarctation of the aorta Cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) Symptoms The symptoms depend on where the aneurysm is located. If the aneurysm occurs near the body's surface, pain and swelling with a throbbing lump is often seen. Aneurysms in the body or brain often cause no symptoms. Aneurysms in the brain may expand without breaking open (rupturing). The expanded aneurysm may press on nerves and cause double vision, dizziness, or headaches. Some aneurysms may cause ringing in the ears. If an aneurysm ruptures, pain, low blood pressure, a rapid heart rate, and lightheadedness may occur. When a brain aneurysm ruptures, there is a sudden severe headache that some people say is the "worst headache of my life." The risk of neurologic injury, coma, or death after a rupture is high. Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform a physical exam. Tests used to diagnose an aneurysm include: CT scan CT angiogram MRI MRA Ultrasound Angiogram Treatment Treatment depends on the size and location of the aneurysm. Your provider may only recommend regular checkups to see if the aneurysm is growing. Surgery may be done. The type of surgery that is done and when you need it depend on your symptoms and the size and type of aneurysm. Surgery may involve a large (open) surgical cut. Sometimes, a procedure called endovascular embolization is done. Coils or stents of metal are inserted into a brain aneurysm to make the aneurysm clot. This reduces the risk for rupture while keeping the artery open. Other brain aneurysms may need to have a clip placed on them to close them off and prevent a rupture. Aneurysms of the aorta may be reinforced with surgery to strengthen the blood vessel wall. When to Contact a Medical Professional Call your provider if you develop a lump on your body, whether or not it is painful and throbbing. Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have: Pain in your belly or back that is very bad or does not go away A sudden or severe headache, especially if you also have nausea, vomiting, seizures, or any other nervous system symptom If you are diagnosed with an aneurysm that has not bled, you will need to have regular testing to detect if it increases in size. Prevention Controlling high blood pressure may help prevent many aneurysms. Follow a healthy diet, get regular exercise, and keep your cholesterol at a healthy level to help prevent aneurysms or their complications. Do not smoke. If you do smoke, quitting will lower your risk for an aneurysm.

Acute cerebellar ataxia is sudden inability to coordinate muscle movement due to disease or injury to the cerebellum. This is the area in the brain that controls muscle movement. Ataxia means loss of muscle coordination, especially of the hands and legs. Causes Acute cerebellar ataxia in children, particularly younger than age 3, may occur several days or weeks after an illness caused by a virus. Viral infections that may cause this include chickenpox , Coxsackie disease, Epstein-Barr, echovirus , among others. Other causes of acute cerebellar ataxia include: Abscess of the cerebellum Alcohol, medicines, insecticides, and illicit drugs Bleeding into the cerebellum Multiple sclerosis Strokes of the cerebellum Vaccination Trauma to head and neck Certain diseases associated with some cancers (paraneoplastic disorders) Symptoms Ataxia may affect movement of the middle part of the body from the neck to the hip area (the trunk) or the arms and legs (limbs). When the person is sitting, the body may move side-to-side, back-to-front, or both. Then the body quickly moves back to a sitting upright position. When a person with ataxia of the arms reaches for an object, the hand may sway back and forth. Common symptoms of ataxia include: Clumsy speech pattern ( dysarthria ) Repetitive eye movements ( nystagmus ) Uncoordinated eye movements Walking problems (unsteady gait) that can lead to falls Difficulty controlling arm movements Exams and Tests The health care provider will ask if the person has recently been sick and will try to rule out any other causes of the problem. Brain and nervous system examination will be done to identify the most affected areas of the nervous system. The following tests may be ordered: CT scan of the head MRI scan of the head Spinal tap Blood tests to detect infections caused by viruses or bacteria Treatment Treatment depends on the cause: If the acute cerebellar ataxia is due to bleeding, surgery may be needed. For an ischemic stroke, medicine to thin the blood can be given. Removing a blood clot from within the blood vessels may also be needed. Infections may need to be treated with antibiotics or antivirals. Corticosteroids may be needed for swelling (inflammation) of the cerebellum (such as from multiple sclerosis). Cerebellar ataxia caused by a recent viral infection may not need treatment. Physical therapy may be needed to reduce risk of falling. Outlook (Prognosis) People whose condition was caused by a recent viral infection should make a full recovery without treatment in a few months. Strokes, bleeding, or infections may cause permanent symptoms. Possible Complications Falls may result in injury. In rare cases, movement or behavioral disorders may persist. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if any symptoms of ataxia appear.

An autoimmune liver disease panel is a group of tests that is done to check for autoimmune liver disease. An autoimmune liver disease means that the body's immune system attacks the liver. These tests include: Anti-liver/kidney microsomal antibodies Anti-mitochondrial antibodies Anti-nuclear antibodies Anti-smooth muscle antibodies Serum IgG The panel may also include other tests. Often, immune protein levels in the blood are also checked. How the Test is Performed A blood sample is taken from a vein . The blood sample is sent to the lab for testing. How to Prepare for the Test You do not need to take special steps before this test. How the Test will Feel You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted to draw blood. Afterward, there may be some throbbing. Why the Test is Performed Autoimmune disorders are a possible cause of liver disease. The most common of these diseases are autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cholangitis (formerly called primary biliary cirrhosis). This group of tests helps your health care provider diagnose specific liver diseases. Normal Results PROTEIN LEVELS: The normal range for protein levels in the blood will change with each laboratory. Please check with your provider for the normal ranges in your particular laboratory. ANTIBODIES: Negative results on all antibodies are normal. Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. The examples above show the common measurements for results of these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens. What Abnormal Results Mean Blood tests for autoimmune diseases are not wholly accurate. They can have false negative results (you have the disease, but the test is negative) and false positive results (you do not have the disease, but the test is positive). A weakly positive or low titer positive test for autoimmune disease is often not due to any disease. A positive test on the panel may be a sign of autoimmune hepatitis or other autoimmune liver disease. If the test is positive mostly for anti-mitochondrial antibodies, you are likely to have primary biliary cholangitis. If the immune proteins are high and albumin is low, you may have liver cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis. Risks Slight risks from having blood drawn include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names Liver disease test panel - autoimmune Images Liver References Bowlus C, Assis DN, Goldberg D.

An atrial myxoma is a noncancerous tumor in the upper left or right side of the heart. It most often grows on the wall that separates the two sides of the heart. This wall is called the atrial septum. Causes A myxoma is a primary heart (cardiac) tumor. This means that the tumor started within the heart. Most heart tumors start somewhere else. Primary cardiac tumors such as myxomas are rare. About 75% of myxomas occur in the left atrium of the heart. They most often begin in the wall that divides the two upper chambers of the heart. They can occur in other intra-cardiac sites as well. Atrial myxomas are sometimes linked with valve obstruction stenosis and atrial fibrillation . Myxomas are more common in women. About 1 in 10 myxomas are passed down through families (inherited). These tumors are called familial myxomas. They tend to occur in more than one part of the heart at a time, and often cause symptoms at a younger age. Symptoms Many myxomas will not cause symptoms. These are often discovered when an imaging study (echocardiogram, MRI, CT) is done for another reason. Symptoms may occur at any time, but often they go along with a change in body position. Symptoms of a myxoma may include: Breathing difficulty when lying flat or on one side or the other Breathing difficulty when asleep Chest pain or tightness Dizziness Fainting Sensation of feeling your heart beat ( palpitations ) Shortness of breath with activity Symptoms due to embolism of tumor material The symptoms and signs of left atrial myxomas often mimic mitral stenosis (narrowing of the valve between the left atrium and the left ventricle). Right atrial myxomas rarely produce symptoms until they have grown to be quite large (5 inches wide, or 13 cm). Other symptoms may include: Bluish skin , especially on the fingers (Raynaud phenomenon) Cough Curvature of nails accompanied by soft tissue swelling ( clubbing ) of the fingers Fever Fingers that change color upon pressure or with cold or stress General discomfort ( malaise ) Joint pain Swelling in any part of the body Weight loss without trying Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform a physical exam and listen to your heart through a stethoscope. Abnormal heart sounds or a murmur may be heard. These sounds may change when you change body position. Imaging tests may include: Chest x-ray CT scan of chest ECG Echocardiogram Doppler study Heart MRI Left heart angiography Right heart angiography You may also need blood tests including: Complete blood count (CBC) - may show anemia and increased white blood cells Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) - may be increased Treatment Surgery is needed to remove the tumor, especially if it is causing heart failure symptoms or an embolism . Outlook (Prognosis) Untreated, a myxoma can lead to an embolism (tumor cells or a clot that breaks off and travels in the bloodstream). This can lead to a blockage of blood flow. Pieces of the tumor can move to the brain, eye, or limbs. If the tumor grows inside the heart, it can block blood flow, causing symptoms of obstruction. Possible Complications Complications may include: Arrhythmias Pulmonary edema Peripheral emboli Blockage of the heart valves Alternative Names Cardiac tumor - myxoma; Heart tumor - myxoma Images Left atrial myxoma Right atrial myxoma References Lenihan DJ, Reardon MJ, Hundley WG.

Acanthosis nigricans (AN) is a skin disorder in which there is darker, thick, velvety skin in body folds and creases. Causes AN can affect otherwise healthy people. It can also be related to medical problems, such as: Genetic disorders, including Down syndrome and Alström syndrome Hormone imbalances that occur in diabetes and obesity, often called insulin resistance Cancer, such as cancer of the digestive system, liver, kidney, bladder, or lymphoma Some medicines, including hormones such as human growth hormone or birth control pills Symptoms AN usually appears slowly and doesn't cause any symptoms other than skin changes. Eventually, dark, velvety skin with very visible markings and creases appears in the armpits, groin and neck folds, and over the joints of the fingers and toes. Sometimes, the lips, palms, soles of the feet, or other areas are affected. These symptoms are more common in people with cancer. Exams and Tests Your health care provider can usually diagnose AN by looking at your skin. A skin biopsy may be needed in rare cases. If there is no clear cause of AN, your provider may order tests. These may include: Blood tests to check blood sugar level or insulin level Endoscopy X-rays Treatment No treatment is needed, as AN only causes a change in skin color. If the condition is affecting your appearance, using moisturizers containing ammonium lactate, tretinoin, or hydroquinone can help lighten the skin. Your provider may also suggest laser treatment. It is important to treat any underlying medical problem that may be causing these skin changes. When AN is related to obesity, losing weight often improves the condition. Outlook (Prognosis) AN often disappears if the cause can be found and treated. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you develop areas of thick, dark, velvety skin.

Asymptomatic HIV infection is the second stage of HIV/AIDS . During this stage, there are no symptoms of HIV infection. This stage is also called chronic HIV infection or clinical latency. During this stage, the virus keeps multiplying in the body and the immune system slowly weakens, but the person has no symptoms. How long this stage lasts depends on how quickly the HIV virus copies itself, and how the person's genes affect the way the body handles the virus. Some people may have symptoms and worsening immune function within a few years after the original infection. Others can go 10 years or longer without symptoms.

In people who have sensitive airways, allergy and asthma symptoms can be triggered by breathing in substances called allergens , or triggers. It is important to know your triggers because avoiding them is your first step toward feeling better. Mold is a common trigger. Molds When your asthma or allergies become worse due to mold, you are said to have a mold allergy. There are many types of mold. They all need water or moisture to grow. Molds send out tiny spores that you cannot see with the naked eye. These spores float through the air, outdoors and indoors. Mold can begin growing indoors when the spores land on wet surfaces. Mold commonly grows in basements, bathrooms, and laundry rooms. Controlling Mold Indoors Fabrics, carpets, stuffed animals, books, and wallpaper can contain mold spores if they are in damp places. Outdoors, mold lives in the soil, on compost, and on plants that are damp. Keeping your house and yard drier will help control mold growth. Central heating and air-conditioning systems can help control mold. Change furnace and air conditioner filters often. Use high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters to best remove mold from the air. In the bathroom: Use an exhaust fan when you shower or take baths. Use a squeegee to wipe water off shower and tub walls after you bathe. Do not leave damp clothes or towels in a basket or hamper. Clean or replace shower curtains when you see mold on them. Keep indoor air dry. Mold thrives in moist air. In the basement: Check your basement for moisture and mold. Use a dehumidifier to keep the air drier. Keeping indoor moisture levels (humidity) between 30% to 50% will keep mold spores down. Empty dehumidifiers daily and clean them often with a vinegar solution. In the rest of the house: Fix leaky faucets and pipes. Keep all sinks and tubs dry and clean. Empty and wash the refrigerator tray that collects water from the freezer defroster often. Frequently clean any surfaces where mold grows in your house. Do not use vaporizers for an extended time to manage symptoms during asthma attacks. Outdoors: Get rid of water that collects around the outside of your house. Stay away from barns, hay, and wood piles. Do not rake leaves or mow grass.

Increased appetite means you have an excess desire for food. Considerations An increased appetite can be a symptom of different diseases. For example, it may be due to a mental condition or a problem with the endocrine gland . An increased appetite can come and go (intermittent), or it can last for long periods of time (persistent). This will depend on the cause. It does not always result in weight gain. The terms "hyperphagia" and "polyphagia" refer to someone who is focused only on eating, or who eats a large amount before feeling full. Causes Causes may include: Anxiety Certain drugs (such as corticosteroids, cyproheptadine, and tricyclic antidepressants) Bulimia (most common in women 18 to 30 years old) Diabetes mellitus (including gestational diabetes ) Graves disease Hyperthyroidism Hypoglycemia Premenstrual syndrome Home Care Emotional support is recommended. Counseling may be needed in some cases. If a medicine is causing increased appetite and weight gain, your health care provider may decrease your dose or have you try another drug. Do not stop taking your medicine without talking to your provider. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if: You have an unexplained, persistent increase in appetite You have other unexplained symptoms What to Expect at Your Office Visit Your provider will do a physical exam and ask questions about your medical history. You also may have a psychological evaluation. Questions may include: What are your typical eating habits? Have you begun dieting or do you have concerns about your weight? What medicines are you taking and have you recently changed the dose or started new ones? Do you use any illicit drugs? Do you get hungry during sleep? Is your hunger related to your menstrual cycle? Have you noticed any other symptoms such as anxiety, palpitations , increased thirst , vomiting , frequent urination , or unintentional weight gain?

Autosomal dominant is one of many ways that a genetic trait or disorder can be passed down through families. In an autosomal dominant disease, if you get the variant gene from only one parent, you can get the disease. Often, one of the parents may also have the disease. However, many autosomal dominant disorders' gene variant arises de novo, or for the first time in a family, in the affected person. Information Inheriting a disease, condition, or trait depends on the type of chromosome affected (nonsex or sex chromosome ). It also depends on whether the trait is dominant or recessive. A single variant gene on one of the first 22 nonsex ( autosomal ) chromosomes from either parent can cause an autosomal disorder. Dominant inheritance means a variant gene from one parent can cause disease. This happens even when the matching gene from the other parent is normal. The variant gene dominates. This disease can also occur as a new condition in a child when neither parent has the variant gene. A parent with an autosomal dominant condition has a 50% chance of having a child with the condition. This is true for each pregnancy. It means that each child's risk for the disease does not depend on whether their sibling has the disease. Children who do not inherit the variant gene will not develop or pass on the disease. If someone is diagnosed with an autosomal dominant disease, their parents should also be tested for the variant gene. Examples of autosomal dominant disorders include Marfan syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1 .

Antithyroglobulin antibody is a test to measure antibodies to a protein called thyroglobulin. This protein is found in thyroid cells, but a small amount leaks out into the bloodstream. Sometimes the immune system produces antibodies against this protein. How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed. How to Prepare for the Test You may be told not to eat or drink anything for several hours (usually overnight). Your health care provider may monitor you or tell you to stop taking certain medicines for a short time before the test because they may affect the test results. Do not stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed This test helps detect possible thyroid problems. Antithyroglobulin antibodies can be a sign of thyroid gland damage caused by the immune system. They may be measured if thyroiditis is suspected. Measuring thyroglobulin antibody levels after treatment for thyroid cancer can help your provider decide what the best test is to monitor you for a recurrence of the cancer. Normal Results A negative test result is a normal result. It means no antibodies to thyroglobulin are found in your blood. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean A positive test means antithyroglobulin antibodies are found in your blood. They may be present with: Graves disease or overactive thyroid Hashimoto thyroiditis Subacute thyroiditis Underactive thyroid Systemic lupus erythematosus Type 1 diabetes Pregnant women and relatives of those with autoimmune thyroiditis may also test positive for these antibodies. If you have a positive test for antithyroglobulin antibodies, this may make it harder to measure your thyroglobulin level accurately. Thyroglobulin level is an important blood test to determine risk that thyroid cancer will recur. Risks There is little risk involved with having your blood taken.Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Multiple punctures to locate veins Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names Thyroglobulin antibody; Thyroiditis - thyroglobulin antibody; Hypothyroidism - thyroglobulin antibody; Thyroiditis - thyroglobulin antibody; Graves disease - thyroglobulin antibody; Underactive thyroid - thyroglobulin antibody Images Blood test References Brent GA, Weetman AP.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme found in many body tissues such as liver, bile ducts, bone, and intestine. There are several different structural forms of ALP called isoenzymes. The structure of the enzyme depends on where in the body it is produced. This test is most often used to test ALP made in the tissues of the liver and bones. The ALP isoenzyme test is a lab test that measures the amounts of different types of ALP in the blood. The ALP test is a related test. How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed. Most of the time blood is drawn from a vein located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. How to Prepare for the Test Many medicines can interfere with blood test results. Your health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test. DO NOT stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first. How the Test will Feel You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn. Why the Test is Performed When the ALP test result is high, you may need to have the ALP isoenzyme test. This test will help determine what part of the body is causing higher ALP levels. This test may be used to diagnose or monitor: Bone disease Liver , gallbladder, or bile duct disease Pain in the abdomen Parathyroid gland disease Vitamin D deficiency It may also be done to check liver function and to see how medicines you take may affect your liver. Normal Results The normal value for total ALP is 44 to 147 international units per liter (IU/L) or 0.73 to 2.45 microkatal per liter (µkat/L). ALP isoenzyme testing may have differing normal values. Adults have lower levels of ALP than children. Bones that are still growing produce higher levels of ALP. During some growth spurts, levels can be as high as 500 IU/L or 835 µKat/L. For this reason, the test is usually not done in children, and abnormal results refer to adults. The isoenzyme test results can reveal whether the increase is in "bone" ALP or "liver" ALP. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. The example above shows the common measurement range for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens. What Abnormal Results Mean Higher-than-normal ALP levels: Biliary obstruction Bone disease Eating a fatty meal if you have blood type O or B Healing fracture Hepatitis Hyperparathyroidism Hyperthyroidism Leukemia Liver disease Lymphoma Osteoblastic bone tumors Osteomalacia Paget disease of bone Sarcoidosis Lower-than-normal levels of ALP: Hypophosphatasia Hypothyroidism Malnutrition Pernicious anemia Protein deficiency Wilson disease Zinc deficiency Levels that are only slightly higher than normal may not be a problem unless there are other signs of a disease or medical problem.

Acrodysostosis is an extremely rare disorder that is present at birth (congenital). It leads to problems with the bones of the hands, feet, and nose, and intellectual disability. Causes Most people with acrodysostosis have no family history of the disease. However, sometimes the condition is passed down from parent to child. Parents with the condition have a 1 in 2 chance of passing the disorder to their children. There is a slightly greater risk with fathers who are older. Symptoms Symptoms of this disorder include: Frequent middle ear infections Growth problems, short arms and legs Hearing problems Intellectual disability The body doesn't respond to certain hormones, even though hormone levels are normal Distinct facial features Exams and Tests The health care provider can usually diagnose this condition with a physical exam. This may show any of the following: Advanced bone age Bone deformities in hands and feet Delays in growth Problems with the skin, genitals, teeth, and skeleton Short arms and legs with small hands and feet Short head, measured front to back Short height Small, upturned broad nose with flat bridge Distinct features of the face (short nose, open mouth, jaw that sticks out) Unusual head Wide-spaced eyes, sometimes with extra skin fold at corner of eye In the first months of life, x-rays may show spotty calcium deposits, called stippling, in bones (especially the nose). Infants may also have: Abnormally short fingers and toes Early growth of bones in the hands and feet Short bones Shortening of the forearm bones near the wrist Two genes have been linked with this condition, and genetic testing may be done. Treatment Treatment depends on the symptoms. Hormones, such as growth hormone, may be given. Surgery to treat bone problems may be done.

The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) blood test measures the level of the enzyme AST in the blood. How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed. How to Prepare for the Test No special preparation is needed. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed AST is an enzyme found in high levels in the liver, heart, and muscles. It is also found in lesser amounts in other tissues. An enzyme is a protein that causes a specific chemical change in the body. Injury to the liver results in release of AST into the blood. This test is mainly done along with other tests (such as ALT , ALP , and bilirubin ) to diagnose and monitor liver disease . Normal Results The normal range is 8 to 33 U/L. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean An increased AST level is often a sign of liver disease. Liver disease is even more likely when the levels of substances checked by other liver blood tests have also increased. An increased AST level may be due to any of the following: Scarring of the liver ( cirrhosis ) Death of liver tissue Heart attack Too much iron in the body ( hemochromatosis ) Swollen and inflamed liver ( hepatitis ) Lack of blood flow to the liver (liver ischemia) Liver cancer or tumor Use of drugs that are toxic to the liver, especially alcohol use Mononucleosis ("mono") Muscle disease or trauma Swollen and inflamed pancreas ( pancreatitis ) AST level may also increase after: Burns (deep) Heart procedures Seizures Surgery Pregnancy and exercise may also cause an increased AST level. Risks There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Fainting or feeling lightheaded Excessive bleeding Multiple punctures to locate veins Hematoma (blood collecting under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names Aspartate aminotransferase; Serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase; SGOT Images Blood test References Daniels L, Khalili M, Goldstein E, Bluth MH, Bowne WB, Pincus MR.

Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is cancer that forms in the soft tissue of the body. Soft tissue connects, supports, or surrounds other body parts. In adults, STS is rare. There are many different types of soft tissue cancers. The type of sarcoma depends on the tissue it forms in: Muscles Tendons Fat Blood vessels Lymph vessels Nerves Tissues in and around joints The cancer can form almost anywhere, but is most common in the: Head Neck Arms Legs Trunk Abdomen Causes It is not known what causes most sarcomas. But there are certain risk factors: Some inherited diseases, such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome Radiation therapy for other cancers Exposure to certain chemicals, such as vinyl chloride or certain herbicides Having swelling in the arms or legs for a long time ( lymphedema ) Symptoms In early stages, there are often no symptoms. As the cancer grows, it may cause a lump or swelling that keeps growing over time. Most lumps are not due to cancer. Other symptoms include: Pain, if it presses on a nerve, organ, blood vessel, or muscle Blockage or bleeding in the stomach or intestines Breathing problems Exams and Tests Your health care provider will ask you about your medical history and do a physical exam. Other tests may include: X-rays CT scan MRI PET scan If your provider suspects cancer, you might have a biopsy to check for cancer. In a biopsy, your provider collects a tissue sample to examine in the lab. The biopsy will show if cancer is present and help show how quickly it is growing. Your provider may ask for more tests to stage the cancer . Staging can tell how much cancer is present and whether it has spread. Treatment Surgery is the most common treatment for STS. In early stages, the tumor and some healthy tissue around it is removed. Sometimes, just a small amount of tissue needs to be removed. Other times, a wider area of tissue must be removed. With advanced cancers that form in an arm or leg, surgery may be followed by radiation or chemotherapy. Rarely, the limb may need to be amputated. You also may have radiation or chemotherapy : Used before surgery to help shrink the tumor to make it easier to remove the cancer Used after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells Chemotherapy may be used to help kill cancer that has metastasized . This means it has spread to different areas of the body. Support Groups Cancer affects how you feel about yourself and your life. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group . Sharing with others who have had the same experiences and problems can help you feel less alone. Ask your provider to help you find a support group for people who have been diagnosed with STS. Outlook (Prognosis) The outlook for people whose cancer is treated early is very good. Most people who survive 5 years can expect to be cancer-free at 10 years. Possible Complications Complications include side effects from surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. When to Contact a Medical Professional See your provider about any lump that grows in size or is painful. Prevention The cause of most STSs isn't known and there is no way to prevent it. Knowing your risk factors and telling your provider when you first notice symptoms can increase your chance of surviving this type of cancer.

Preparing for a medical test or procedure can reduce anxiety, encourage cooperation, and help your teen develop coping skills. Information There are many ways to help teens prepare for a medical test or procedure. First, explain the reasons for the procedure. Let your teen take part and make as many decisions as possible. PREPARING BEFORE THE PROCEDURE Explain the procedure in correct medical terms. Tell your teen why the test is being done. (Ask your health care provider to explain it if you are not sure.) Understanding the need for the procedure may reduce your teen's anxiety. To the best of your ability, describe how the test will feel. Allow your teen to practice the positions or movements that will be required for the test, such as the fetal position for a lumbar puncture (spinal tap). Be honest about discomfort your teen may feel, but don't dwell on it. It may help to stress the benefits of the test, and to say that the test results may provide more information. Talk about things that your teen may enjoy after the test, such as feeling better or going home. Rewards such as shopping trips or movies may be helpful if the adolescent is able to do them. Tell your teen as much as you can about the equipment that will be used for the test. If the procedure will take place in a new location, it may help to tour the facility with your teen before the test. Suggest ways for your teen to stay calm, such as: Blowing bubbles Breathing deeply Counting Creating a quiet, peaceful environment Doing relaxation techniques (thinking pleasant thoughts) Holding the hand of a calm parent (or someone else) during the procedure Playing hand-held video games Using guided imagery Trying other distractions, such as listening to music through headphones, if allowed When possible, let your teen make some decisions, such as deciding the time of day or the date of the procedure. The more control a person has over a procedure, the less painful and anxiety-producing it is likely to be. Allow your teen to participate in simple tasks during the procedure, such as holding an instrument, if allowed. Discuss possible risks. Teens are often concerned about risks, particularly about any effects on their appearance, mental function, and sexuality. Address these fears honestly and openly if at all possible. Provide information about any appearance changes or other possible side effects the test may cause. Older teens may benefit from videos that show adolescents of the same age explaining the procedure. Ask your provider if such videos are available for your teen to view. It may also be helpful for your adolescent to discuss any concerns with peers who have managed similar stressful procedures. Ask your provider if they know any teens who are interested in doing peer counseling, or if they can recommend a local support group. DURING THE PROCEDURE If the procedure is done at a hospital or your provider's office, ask if you can stay with your teen. However, if your teen doesn't want you to be there, honor this wish. Out of respect for your adolescent's growing need for privacy and independence, don't allow peers or siblings to watch the procedure unless your teen asks them to be there. Do not show your own anxiety. Looking anxious will make your adolescent more upset and worried. Research suggests that children are more cooperative if their parents take measures to reduce their own anxiety. Other considerations: Ask your provider to limit the number of strangers entering and leaving the room during the procedure. This can raise anxiety. Ask that the provider who has spent the most time with your teen be present during the procedure, if possible. Otherwise, your adolescent may show some resistance. Prepare your adolescent in advance for the possibility that the test will be done by someone they don't know. Ask if anesthesia is an option to reduce any discomfort. Assure your teen that their reactions are normal.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a protein found in all body tissues. Tissues with higher amounts of ALP include the liver, bile ducts, and bone. A blood test can be done to measure the level of ALP. A related test is the ALP isoenzyme test . How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed. Most of the time, blood is drawn from a vein located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. How to Prepare for the Test Many medicines can interfere with blood test results. Your health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test. DO NOT stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first. How the Test will Feel You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn. Why the Test is Performed This test may be done: To diagnose liver or bone disease To check if treatments for those diseases are working To check for side effects from medicines Normal Results The normal range is 44 to 147 international units per liter (IU/L) or 0.73 to 2.45 microkatal per liter (µkat/L). Normal values may vary slightly from laboratory to laboratory. They also can vary with age and sex. High levels of ALP are normally seen in children undergoing growth spurts and in pregnant women. The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens. What Abnormal Results Mean Abnormal results may be due to the following conditions: Higher-than-normal ALP levels Biliary obstruction Bone disease Eating a fatty meal if you have blood type O or B Healing fracture Hepatitis Hyperparathyroidism Hyperthyroidism Leukemia Liver disease Lymphoma Osteoblastic bone tumors Osteomalacia Paget disease of bone Sarcoidosis Lower-than-normal ALP levels Hypophosphatasia Hypothyroidism Malnutrition Pernicious anemia Protein deficiency Wilson disease Zinc deficiency Other conditions for which the test may be done: Alcoholic liver disease (hepatitis/cirrhosis) Alcohol use disorder Biliary stricture Gallstones Giant cell (temporal, cranial) arteritis Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) II Pancreatitis Renal cell carcinoma Alternative Names Alkaline phosphatase Images Blood test References Fogel EL, Sherman S.

Amaurosis fugax is a temporary loss of vision in one or both eyes due to a lack of blood flow to the retina . The retina is the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eyeball. Causes Amaurosis fugax is not itself a disease. Instead, it is a sign of other disorders. Amaurosis fugax can occur from different causes. One cause is when a blood clot or a piece of plaque blocks an artery in the eye. The blood clot or plaque usually travels from a larger artery, such as the carotid artery in the neck or an artery in the heart, to an artery in the eye. Plaque is a hard substance that forms when fat, cholesterol, and other substances build up in the walls of arteries. Risk factors include: Heart disease, especially irregular heartbeat Alcohol abuse Cocaine use Diabetes Family history of stroke High blood pressure High cholesterol Increasing age Smoking (people who smoke one pack a day double their risk for a stroke) Amaurosis fugax can also occur because of other disorders such as: Other eye problems, such as inflammation of the optic nerve ( optic neuritis ) Blood vessel disease called polyarteritis nodosa Migraine headaches Brain tumor Head injury Multiple sclerosis ( MS ), inflammation of the nerves due to the body's immune cells attacking the nervous system Systemic lupus erythematosus , an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune cells attack healthy tissue throughout the body Symptoms Symptoms include the sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes. This usually lasts for a few seconds to several minutes. Afterward, vision returns to normal. Some people describe the loss of vision as a gray or black shade coming down over the eye. Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform a complete eye and nervous system exam. In some cases, an eye exam will reveal a bright spot where the clot is blocking the retinal artery. Tests that may be done include: Ultrasound or magnetic resonance angiography scan of the carotid artery to check for blood clots or plaque Blood tests to check cholesterol and blood sugar levels Tests of the heart, such as an ECG to check its electrical activity Treatment Treatment of amaurosis fugax depends on its cause. When amaurosis fugax is due to a blood clot or plaque, the concern is to prevent a stroke. The following can help prevent a stroke: Avoid fatty foods and follow a healthy, low-fat diet. DO NOT drink more than 1 to 2 alcoholic drinks a day. Exercise regularly: 30 minutes a day if you are not overweight; 60 to 90 minutes a day if you are overweight. Quit smoking. Most people should aim for a blood pressure below 120 to 130/80 mm Hg. If you have diabetes or have had a stroke, your doctor may tell you to aim for a lower blood pressure. If you have diabetes, heart disease, or hardening of the arteries, your LDL (bad) cholesterol should be lower than 70 mg/dL. Follow your doctor's treatment plans if you have high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or heart disease. Your doctor may also recommend: No treatment. You may only need regular visits to check the health of your heart and carotid arteries. Aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin), or other blood-thinning drugs to lower your risk for stroke. If a large part of the carotid artery appears blocked, carotid endarterectomy surgery is done to remove the blockage. The decision to do surgery is also based on your overall health. Outlook (Prognosis) Amaurosis fugax increases your risk for stroke. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if any vision loss occurs. If symptoms last longer than a few minutes or if there are other symptoms with the vision loss, seek medical attention right away.

Anorchia is the absence of both testes at birth. Causes The embryo develops early sex organs in the first several weeks of pregnancy. In some cases, early testes do not develop in males before 8 weeks into the pregnancy. These babies will be born with female sex organs. In some cases, the testes disappear between 8 and 10 weeks. These babies will be born with ambiguous genitalia . This means the child will have parts of both male and female sex organs. In some cases, the testes may disappear between 12 and 14 weeks. These babies will have normal penis and scrotum. However, they will not have any testes. This is known as congenital anorchia. It is also called the "vanishing testes syndrome." The cause is unknown. Genetic factors may be involved in some cases. This condition should not be confused with bilateral undescended testes , in which the testes are located in the abdomen or groin rather than the scrotum. Symptoms Symptoms may include: Normal outside genitals before puberty Failure to start puberty at the correct time Exams and Tests Signs include: Empty scrotum Lack of male sex characteristics (penis and pubic hair growth, deepening of the voice, and increase in muscle mass) Tests include: Anti-Müllerian hormone levels Bone density Follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) levels Surgery to look for male reproductive tissue Testosterone levels (low) Ultrasound or MRI to look for testes in the abdomen XY karyotype Treatment Treatment includes: Artificial (prosthetic) testicle implants Male hormones (androgens) Psychological support Outlook (Prognosis) The outlook is good with treatment.

Anemia is a problem in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells bring oxygen to body tissues. Iron helps make red blood cells, so a lack of iron in the body may lead to anemia. The medical name of this problem is iron deficiency anemia. Causes Anemia caused by a low iron level is the most common form of anemia. The body gets iron through certain foods. It also reuses iron from old red blood cells. A diet that does not have enough iron is the most common cause. During periods of rapid growth, even more iron is needed. Babies are born with iron stored in their bodies. Because they grow rapidly, infants and toddlers need to absorb a lot of iron each day. Iron deficiency anemia most commonly affects babies 9 through 24 months old. Breastfed babies need less iron because iron is absorbed better when it is in breast milk. Formula with iron added (iron fortified) also provides enough iron. Infants younger than 12 months who drink cow's milk rather than breast milk or iron-fortified formula are more likely to have anemia. Cow's milk leads to anemia because it: Has less iron Causes small amounts of blood loss from the intestines Makes it harder for the body to absorb iron Children older than 12 months who drink too much cow's milk may also have anemia if they do not eat enough other healthy foods that have iron. Symptoms Mild anemia may have no symptoms. As the iron level and blood counts become lower, your infant or toddler may: Act irritable Become short of breath Crave unusual foods (called pica) Eat less food Feel tired or weak all the time Have a sore tongue Have headaches or dizziness With more severe anemia, your child may have: Blue-tinged or pale whites of eyes Brittle nails Pale skin color Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform a physical exam. All babies should have a blood test to check for anemia. Blood tests that measure iron level in the body include: Hematocrit Serum ferritin Serum iron Total iron binding capacity (TIBC) A measurement called iron saturation (serum iron/TIBC) often can show whether the child has enough iron in the body. Treatment Since children only absorb a small amount of the iron they eat, most children need to have 8 to 10 mg of iron per day. DIET AND IRON During the first year of life: Do not give your baby cow's milk until age 1 year. Babies under age 1 year have a difficult time digesting cow's milk. Use either breast milk or formula fortified with iron. After 6 months, your baby will start to need more iron in their diet. Start solid foods with iron-fortified baby cereal mixed with breast milk or formula. Iron-rich pureed meats, fruits, and vegetables can also be started. After age 1 year, you may give your baby whole milk in place of breast milk or formula. Eating healthy foods is the most important way to prevent and treat iron deficiency. Good sources of iron include: Apricots Chicken, turkey, fish, and other meats Dried beans, lentils, and soybeans Eggs Liver Molasses Oatmeal Peanut butter Prune juice Raisins and prunes Spinach, kale and other greens IRON SUPPLEMENTS If a healthy diet does not prevent or treat your child's low iron level and anemia, the provider will likely recommend iron supplements for your child. These are taken by mouth. Do not give your child iron supplements or vitamins with iron without checking with your child's provider. The provider will prescribe the right kind of supplement for your child. If your child takes too much iron, it can cause poisoning. Outlook (Prognosis) With treatment, the outcome is likely to be good. In most cases, the blood counts will return to normal in 2 months. It is important that the provider find the cause of your child's iron deficiency. Possible Complications A low iron level can cause decreased attention span, reduced alertness and learning problems in children. A low iron level can cause the body to absorb too much lead. Prevention Eating healthy foods is the most important way to prevent and treat iron deficiency. Alternative Names Anemia - iron deficiency - infants and toddlers References Baker RD, Baker SS.

Adenoid removal is surgery to take out the adenoid glands. The adenoid glands sit behind your nose above the roof of your mouth in the nasopharynx. Air passes over these glands when you take a breath. The adenoids are often taken out at the same time as the tonsils ( tonsillectomy ). Adenoid removal is also called adenoidectomy. The procedure is most often done in children. Description Your child will be given general anesthesia before surgery. This means your child will be asleep and unable to feel pain. During surgery: The surgeon places a small tool into your child's mouth to keep it open. The surgeon removes the adenoid glands using a spoon-shaped tool (curette). Or, another tool that helps cut away soft tissue is used. Some surgeons use electricity to heat the tissue, remove it, and stop bleeding. This is called electrocautery. Another method uses radiofrequency (RF) energy to do the same thing. This is called coblation. A cutting tool called a microdebrider can also be used to remove the adenoid tissue. Absorbent material called packing material may also be used to control bleeding. Your child will stay in the recovery room after surgery. You will be allowed to take your child home when your child is awake and can breathe easily, cough, and swallow. In most cases, this will be a few hours after surgery. Why the Procedure is Performed A health care provider may recommend this procedure if: Enlarged adenoids are blocking your child's airway. Symptoms in your child can include heavy snoring, problems breathing through the nose, and episodes of not breathing during sleep. Your child has chronic ear infections that occur often, continue despite use of antibiotics, cause hearing loss, or cause your child to miss a lot of school days. Adenoidectomy may also be recommended if your child has tonsillitis that keeps coming back. The adenoids normally shrink as children grow older. Adults rarely need to have them removed. Risks Risks of any anesthesia are: Reactions to medicines Breathing problems Risks of any surgery are: Bleeding Infection Before the Procedure Your provider will tell you how to prepare your child for this procedure. A week before the surgery, do not give your child any medicine that thins the blood unless your doctor says to do so. Such medicines include aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin). The night before the surgery, your child should have nothing to eat or drink after midnight. This includes water. You will be told what medicines your child should take on the day of surgery. Have your child take the medicine with a sip of water. After the Procedure Your child will go home on the same day as surgery. Complete recovery takes about 1 to 2 weeks. Follow instructions on how to care for your child at home . Outlook (Prognosis) After this procedure, most children: Breathe better through the nose Have fewer and milder sore throats Have fewer ear infections In rare cases, adenoid tissue may grow back. This does not cause problems most of the time. However, it can be removed again if necessary.

Ascariasis is an infection with the parasitic roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides . Causes People get ascariasis by consuming food or drink that is contaminated with roundworm eggs. Ascariasis is the most common intestinal worm infection. It is related to poor sanitation. People who live in places where human feces (stool) are used as fertilizer are also at risk for this disease. Once consumed, the eggs hatch and release immature roundworms called larvae inside the small intestine. Within a few days, the larvae move through the bloodstream to the lungs. They travel up through the large airways of the lungs and are swallowed back into the stomach and small intestine. As the larvae move through the lungs they may cause an uncommon form of pneumonia called eosinophilic pneumonia. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell. Once the larvae are back in the small intestine, they mature into adult roundworms. Adult worms live in the small intestine, where they lay eggs that are present in feces. They can live 10 to 24 months. An estimated 1 billion people are infected worldwide. Ascariasis occurs in people of all ages, though children are affected more severely than adults. Symptoms Most of the time, there are no symptoms. If there are symptoms, they may include: Bloody sputum (mucus coughed up by the lower airways) Cough, wheezing Low-grade fever Passing worms in stool Shortness of breath Skin rash Stomach pain Vomiting or coughing up worms Worms leaving the body through the nose or mouth Exams and Tests The infected person may show signs of malnutrition. Tests to diagnose this condition include: Abdominal x-ray or other imaging tests Blood tests, including complete blood count and eosinophil count Stool exam to look for worms and worm eggs Treatment Treatment includes medicines such as albendazole that paralyze or kill intestinal parasitic worms. If there is a blockage of the intestine caused by a large number of worms, a procedure called endoscopy may be used to remove the worms. In rare cases, surgery is needed. People who are treated for roundworms should be checked again in 3 months. This involves examining the stools to check for eggs of the worm. If eggs are present, treatment should be given again. Outlook (Prognosis) Most people recover from symptoms of the infection, even without treatment. But they may continue to carry the worms in their body. Complications can be caused by adult worms that move to certain organs, such as the: Appendix Bile duct Pancreas If the worms multiply, they can block the intestine. Possible Complications These complications may occur: Appendicitis Blockage in the bile ducts of the liver Blockage in the intestine Hole in the gut When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your health care provider if you have symptoms of ascariasis, particularly if you have traveled to an area where the disease is common. Also call if you have any of the following: Symptoms get worse Symptoms do not improve with treatment New symptoms occur Prevention Improved sanitation and hygiene in developing countries will reduce the risk in those areas. In places where ascariasis is common, people may be given deworming medicines as a preventive measure.

Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a cancer of the adrenal glands . The adrenal glands are two triangle-shaped glands. One gland is located on top of each kidney. Causes ACC is most common in children younger than 5 years old and adults in their 40s and 50s. The condition may be linked to a cancer syndrome that is passed down through families (inherited). Both men and women can develop this tumor. ACC can produce the hormones cortisol, aldosterone, estrogen, or testosterone, as well as other hormones. In women the tumor often releases these hormones, which can lead to male characteristics. ACC is very rare. The cause is unknown. Symptoms Symptoms of increased cortisol or other adrenal gland hormones may include: Fatty, rounded hump high on the back just below the neck ( buffalo hump ) Flushed, rounded face with pudgy cheeks ( moon face ) Obesity Stunted growth ( short stature ) Virilization -- the appearance of male characteristics, including increased body hair (especially on the face), pubic hair, acne, deepening of the voice, and enlarged clitoris (females) Symptoms of increased aldosterone are the same as symptoms of low potassium, and include: Muscle cramps Weakness Pain in the abdomen Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. Blood tests will be done to check hormone levels: ACTH level will be low. Aldosterone level will be high. Cortisol level will be high. Potassium level will be low. Male or female hormones may be abnormally high. Imaging tests of the abdomen may include: Ultrasound CT scan MRI PET scan Treatment Primary treatment is surgery to remove the tumor. ACC may not improve with chemotherapy . Medicines may be given to reduce production of cortisol, which causes many of the symptoms. Outlook (Prognosis) The outcome depends on how early the diagnosis is made and whether the tumor has spread (metastasized). Tumors that have spread usually lead to death within 1 to 3 years. Possible Complications The tumor can spread to the liver, bone, lung, or other areas. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you or your child has symptoms of ACC, Cushing syndrome , or failure to grow.

With age, a woman's breasts lose fat, tissue, and mammary glands. Many of these changes are due to the decrease in the body's production of estrogen that occurs at menopause. Without estrogen, the gland tissue shrinks, making the breasts smaller and less full. The connective tissue that supports the breasts becomes less elastic, so the breasts sag. Changes also occur in the nipple. The area surrounding the nipple (the areola) becomes smaller and may nearly disappear. The nipple may also turn in slightly. Breast lumps are common around the time of menopause. These are usually noncancerous cysts. However, if you notice a lump, make an appointment with your health care provider, because breast cancer risk increases with age. Women should be aware of the benefits and limitations of breast self-exams. These exams do not always pick up early stages of breast cancer. Women should talk to their providers about regular physical examinations and mammogram to screen for breast cancer. Images Female breast Mammary gland References Davidson NE.

Amebiasis is an infection of the intestines. It is caused by the microscopic parasite Entamoeba histolytica . Causes E histolytica can live in the large intestine (colon) without causing damage to the intestine. In some cases, it invades the colon wall, causing colitis , acute dysentery, or long-term (chronic) diarrhea. The infection can also spread through the bloodstream to the liver. In rare cases, it can spread to the lungs, brain, or other organs. This condition occurs worldwide. It is most common in tropical areas that have crowded living conditions and poor sanitation. Africa, Mexico, parts of South America, and India have major health problems due to this condition. The parasite may spread: Through food or water contaminated with stool Through fertilizer made of human waste From person to person, particularly by contact with the mouth or rectal area of an infected person Risk factors for severe amebiasis include: Alcohol use Cancer Malnutrition Older or younger age Pregnancy Recent travel to a tropical region Use of corticosteroid medicine to suppress the immune system In the United States, amebiasis is most common among those who live in institutions or people who have traveled to an area where amebiasis is common. Symptoms Most people with this infection do not have symptoms. If symptoms occur, they are seen 7 to 28 days after being exposed to the parasite. Mild symptoms may include: Abdominal cramps Diarrhea: passage of 3 to 8 semiformed stools per day, or passage of soft stools with mucus and occasional blood Fatigue Excessive gas Rectal pain while having a bowel movement ( tenesmus ) Unintentional weight loss Severe symptoms may include: Abdominal tenderness Bloody stools , including passage of liquid stools with streaks of blood, passage of 10 to 20 stools per day Fever Vomiting Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform a physical exam. You will be asked about your medical history, especially if you have recently traveled overseas. Examination of the abdomen may show liver enlargement or tenderness in the abdomen (typically in the right upper quadrant). Tests that may be ordered include: Blood test for amebiasis Examination of the inside of the lower large bowel ( sigmoidoscopy ) Stool test Microscope examination of stool samples , usually with multiple samples over several days Treatment Treatment depends on how severe the infection is. Usually, antibiotics are prescribed. If you are vomiting, you may be given medicines through a vein ( intravenously ) until you can take them by mouth. Medicines to stop diarrhea are usually not prescribed because they can make the condition worse. After antibiotic treatment, your stool will likely be rechecked to make sure the infection has been cleared. Outlook (Prognosis) Outcome is usually good with treatment. Usually, the illness lasts about 2 weeks, but it can come back if you do not get treated. Possible Complications Complications of amebiasis may include: Liver abscess (collection of parasites and pus in the liver) Medicine side effects, including nausea Spread of the parasite through the blood to the liver, lungs, brain, or other organs When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have diarrhea that does not go away or gets worse. Prevention When traveling in countries where sanitation is poor, drink purified or boiled water. Do not eat uncooked vegetables or unpeeled fruit. Wash your hands after using the bathroom and before eating.

Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. There are many types of anemia. Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) is anemia that is found in people with certain long-term (chronic) medical conditions that involve inflammation. Causes Anemia is a lower-than-normal number of red blood cells in the blood. ACD is a common cause of anemia. Some conditions that can lead to ACD include: Autoimmune disorders , such as Crohn disease , systemic lupus erythematosus , rheumatoid arthritis , and ulcerative colitis Cancer , including lymphoma and Hodgkin disease Long-term infections, such as bacterial endocarditis , osteomyelitis (bone infection), HIV/AIDS , lung abscess, hepatitis B or hepatitis C Symptoms Anemia of chronic disease is often mild. You may not notice any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may include: Feeling weak or tired Headache Paleness Shortness of breath Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. Anemia may be the first symptom of a serious illness, so finding its cause is very important. Tests that may be done to diagnose anemia or rule out other causes include: Complete blood count (CBC) Reticulocyte count Serum ferritin level Serum iron level C-reactive protein level Erythrocyte sedimentation rate Bone marrow aspiration (in rare cases to check for cancer) Treatment Anemia is often mild enough that it does not need treatment. It may get better when the disease that is causing it is treated. More severe anemia, such as that caused by cancer or HIV/AIDS may require: Blood transfusion Erythropoietin, a hormone produced by the kidneys, given as a shot Outlook (Prognosis) The anemia will improve when the disease that is causing it is treated. Possible Complications Discomfort from symptoms is the main complication in most cases. Anemia may lead to a higher risk for death in people with heart failure. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have a long-term (chronic) disorder and you develop symptoms of anemia.

Aflatoxins are toxins produced by a mold (fungus) that grows on nuts, seeds, and legumes. Function Although aflatoxins are known to cause cancer in animals, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows them at low levels in nuts, seeds, and legumes because they are considered "unavoidable contaminants." The FDA believes occasionally eating small amounts of aflatoxin poses little risk over a lifetime. It is not practical to attempt to remove all traces of aflatoxin from food products in order to make them safer. Food Sources The mold that produces aflatoxin may be found in the following foods: Peanuts and peanut butter Tree nuts, such as pecans Corn Wheat Oil seeds, such as cottonseed Side Effects Aflatoxins ingested in large mounts may cause acute liver damage. Chronic intoxication may lead to weight gain or weight loss, loss of appetite, or infertility in men. Recommendations To help minimize risk, the FDA tests foods that may contain aflatoxin. Peanuts and peanut butter are some of the most rigorously tested products because they often contain aflatoxins and are widely eaten. You can reduce aflatoxin intake by: Buying only major brands of nuts and nut butters Discarding any nuts that look moldy, discolored, or shriveled References Murray PR, Rosenthal KS, Pfaller MA.

Absence of a woman's monthly menstrual period is called amenorrhea. Secondary amenorrhea is when a woman who has been having normal menstrual cycles stops getting her periods for 6 months or longer. Causes Secondary amenorrhea can occur due to natural changes in the body. For example, the most common cause of secondary amenorrhea is pregnancy. Breastfeeding and menopause are also common, but natural causes. Women who take birth control pills or who receive hormone shots such as Depo-Provera may not have any monthly bleeding. When they stop taking these hormones, their periods may not return for more than 6 months. You are more likely to have absent periods if you: Are obese Exercise too much and for long periods of time Have low body fat (less than 15% to 17%) Have severe anxiety or emotional distress Lose a lot of weight suddenly (for example, from strict or extreme diets or after gastric bypass surgery ) Other causes include: Drugs for cancer treatment Medicines to treat schizophrenia or psychosis Overactive thyroid gland Pituitary tumors Polycystic ovarian syndrome Reduced function of the ovaries Premature ovarian failure Also, procedures such as a dilation and curettage ( D and C ) can cause scar tissue to form. This tissue may cause a woman to stop menstruating. This is called Asherman syndrome . Scarring may also be caused by some severe pelvic infections. Symptoms In addition to having no menstrual periods, other symptoms can include: Breast size changes Weight gain or weight loss Discharge from the breast or change in breast size Acne and increased hair growth in a male pattern Vaginal dryness Voice changes If amenorrhea is caused by a pituitary tumor, there may be other symptoms related to the tumor, such as vision loss and headache . Exams and Tests A physical exam and pelvic exam must be done to check for pregnancy. A pregnancy test will be done. Blood tests may be done to check hormone levels, including: Estradiol levels Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH level) Luteinizing hormone (LH level) Prolactin level Testosterone level Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) Other tests that may be performed include: CT scan or MRI scan of the head to look for tumors Biopsy of the lining of the uterus Genetic testing Ultrasound of the pelvis or hysterosonogram (pelvic ultrasound that involves putting saline solution inside the uterus) Treatment Treatment depends on the cause of amenorrhea. Normal monthly periods most often return after the condition is treated. A lack of menstrual period due to obesity , vigorous exercise, or weight loss may respond to a change in exercise routine or weight control (gain or loss, as needed). Outlook (Prognosis) The outlook depends on the cause of amenorrhea. Many of the conditions that cause secondary amenorrhea will respond to treatment. When to Contact a Medical Professional See your primary health care provider or women's health care provider if you have missed more than one period so you can get diagnosed and treated, if needed.

Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. Different types of anemia include: Anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency Anemia due to folate (folic acid) deficiency Anemia due to iron deficiency Anemia of chronic disease Hemolytic anemia Idiopathic aplastic anemia Megaloblastic anemia Pernicious anemia Sickle cell anemia Thalassemia Iron deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia. Causes Although many parts of the body help make red blood cells, most of the work is done in the bone marrow. Bone marrow is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells. Healthy red blood cells last between 90 and 120 days. Parts of your body then remove old blood cells. A hormone called erythropoietin (EPO) made in your kidneys signals your bone marrow to make more red blood cells. Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying protein inside red blood cells. It gives red blood cells their color. People with anemia do not have enough hemoglobin. The body needs certain vitamins, minerals, and nutrients to make enough red blood cells. Iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid are three of the most important ones. The body may not have enough of these nutrients due to: Changes in the lining of the stomach or intestines that affect how well nutrients are absorbed (for example, celiac disease ) Poor diet Surgery that removes part of the stomach or intestines Possible causes of anemia include: Iron deficiency Vitamin B12 deficiency Folate deficiency Certain medicines Destruction of red blood cells earlier than normal (which may be caused by immune system problems) Long-term (chronic) diseases such as chronic kidney disease, cancer, ulcerative colitis , or rheumatoid arthritis Some forms of anemia, such as thalassemia or sickle cell anemia, which can be inherited Pregnancy Problems with bone marrow such as lymphoma, leukemia , myelodysplasia, multiple myeloma , or aplastic anemia Slow blood loss (for example, from heavy menstrual periods or stomach ulcers ) Sudden heavy blood loss Symptoms You may have no symptoms if the anemia is mild or if the problem develops slowly. Symptoms that may occur first include: Feeling weak or tired more often than usual, or with exercise Headaches Problems concentrating or thinking Irritability Loss of appetite Numbness and tingling of hands and feet If the anemia gets worse, symptoms may include: Blue color to the whites of the eyes Brittle nails Desire to eat ice or other non-food things ( pica syndrome) Lightheadedness when you stand up Pale skin color Shortness of breath with mild activity or even at rest Sore or inflamed tongue Mouth ulcers Abnormal or increased menstrual bleeding in females Loss of sexual desire in men Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical examination, and may find: A heart murmur Low blood pressure, especially when you stand up Slight fever Pale skin Rapid heart rate Some types of anemia may cause other findings on a physical exam. Blood tests used to diagnose some common types of anemia may include: Blood levels of iron, vitamin B12, folic acid, and other vitamins and minerals Complete blood count Reticulocyte count Other tests may be done to find medical problems that can cause anemia. Treatment Treatment should be directed at the cause of the anemia, and may include: Blood transfusions Corticosteroids or other medicines that suppress the immune system Erythropoietin, a medicine that helps your bone marrow make more blood cells Supplements of iron, vitamin B12, folic acid, or other vitamins and minerals Possible Complications Severe anemia can cause low oxygen levels in vital organs such as the heart, and can lead to heart failure .

Apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100) is a protein that plays a role in moving cholesterol around your body. It is a form of low density lipoprotein (LDL). Mutations (changes) in the gene that directs the body's production of apoB100 can cause a condition called familial hypercholesterolemia . This is a form of high blood cholesterol that is passed down in families (inherited). This article discusses the test used to measure the level of apoB100 in the blood. How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed . How to Prepare for the Test Your health care provider may tell you not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, you may feel moderate pain, or only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing. Why the Test is Performed Most often, this test is done to help determine the cause or specific type of high blood cholesterol. It is not clear whether the information helps improve treatment. Because of this, most health insurance companies do not pay for the test. If you do not have a diagnosis of high cholesterol or heart disease, this test may not be recommended for you. Normal Results The normal range is about 50 to 150 mg/dL. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean An abnormal result may mean you have high lipid (fat) levels in your blood. A medical term for this is hyperlipidemia . Other disorders that may be associated with high apoB100 levels include atherosclerotic vascular disease such as angina pectoris (chest pain that occurs with activity or stress) and heart attack . Risks Risks linked with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Multiple punctures to locate veins Considerations Apolipoprotein measurements may provide more detail about your risk for heart disease, but the added value of this test beyond a lipid panel is unknown.

You have had an abortion procedure. This procedure ends pregnancy by removing the fetus and placenta from your uterus (womb). What to Expect at Home These procedures are very safe and low risk. You will likely recover without problems. It may take a few days to feel well. You may have cramps that feel like menstrual cramps for a few days to 2 weeks. You may have light vaginal bleeding or spotting for up to 4 weeks. Your normal period will likely return in 4 to 6 weeks. You may feel a sense of relief, or feel sad or depressed after this procedure. You may have a mix of emotions. This is normal. If these feelings do not go away or interfere with your daily life, seek help from your health care provider or a counselor. A family member or friend can also provide comfort. Self-care To relieve discomfort or pain in your abdomen: Apply a heating pad to your lower abdomen or place a hot water bottle filled with warm water on your abdomen. Take over-the-counter painkillers as instructed. Follow these activity guidelines after your procedure: Rest as needed. Do not do any strenuous activity the first few days. This includes not lifting anything heavier than 10 pounds or 4.5 kilograms (about the weight of a 1-gallon or 4-liter milk jug). Also, do not do any strenuous aerobic activity, including running or working out until cleared by your provider. Light housework is fine. Use pads to absorb bleeding and drainage from your vagina. Change the pads every 2 to 4 hours to avoid infection. Do not use tampons or put anything in your vagina, including douching for 1 week. Do not have vaginal intercourse for 2 to 3 weeks, or until cleared by your provider. Take any other medicines, such as antibiotics, as instructed. Begin using birth control right after your procedure. It is possible to get pregnant again even before your normal period resumes. Birth control can help prevent unplanned pregnancies. Be aware though, unplanned pregnancies can occur even when you use birth control. Do not take a bath or swim for 1 week unless your provider tells you it is OK. Showering is OK. When to Call the Doctor Contact your provider if: You have vaginal bleeding that increases or you need to change your pads more often than every hour. You feel lightheaded or dizzy. You have chest pain or shortness of breath. You have swelling or pain in one leg. You have continued pain or pregnancy symptoms beyond 2 weeks. You have signs of infection, including fever that does not go away, vaginal drainage with a foul odor, vaginal drainage that looks like pus, or pain or tenderness in your abdomen.

Allergic rhinitis is a group of symptoms that affect your nose. They occur when you breathe in something you are allergic to, such as dust mites, animal dander, or pollen. Allergic rhinitis is also called hay fever. Avoid Your Triggers Things that make allergies worse are called triggers. It may be impossible to completely avoid all triggers. But, you can do many things to limit your or your child's exposure to them: Reduce dust and dust mites in the home. Control molds indoors and out. Avoid exposure to plant pollen and animals. Some changes you may need to make include: Installing furnace filters or other air filters Removing furniture and carpets from your floors Using a dehumidifier to dry the air in your house Changing where your pets sleep and eat Avoiding certain outdoor tasks Changing how you clean your house The amount of pollen in the air can affect whether hay fever symptoms develop. More pollen is in the air on hot, dry, windy days. On cool, damp, rainy days, most pollen is washed to the ground. Medicines for Allergic Rhinitis Nasal corticosteroid sprays are the most effective treatment. Many brands are available. You can buy some brands without a prescription. For other brands, you need a prescription. They work best when you use them every day. It may take 2 or more weeks of steady use for your symptoms to improve. They are safe for children and adults. Antihistamines are medicines that work well for treating allergy symptoms. They are often used when symptoms do not occur very often or do not last very long. Many can be bought as a pill, capsule, or liquid without a prescription. Older antihistamines can cause sleepiness. They may affect a child's ability to learn and make it unsafe for adults to drive or use machinery. Newer antihistamines cause little or no sleepiness or learning problems. Antihistamine nasal sprays work well for treating allergic rhinitis. They are only available with a prescription. Decongestants are medicines that help dry up a runny or stuffy nose. They come as pills, liquids, capsules, or nasal sprays. You can buy them over-the-counter (OTC), without a prescription. You can use them along with antihistamine pills or liquids. Do not use nasal spray decongestants for more than 3 days in a row. Talk to your child's health care provider before giving decongestants to your child. Nasal Wash For mild allergic rhinitis, a nasal wash can help remove mucus from your nose. You can buy a saline spray at a drugstore or make one at home. To make a nasal wash, use 1 cup (240 milliliters) of purchased distilled water, 1/2 a teaspoon (2.5 grams) of salt, and a pinch of baking soda. When to Call the Doctor Make an appointment with your provider if: You have severe allergy or hay fever symptoms. Your symptoms do not get better when you treat them. You are wheezing or coughing more.

Anisocoria is unequal pupil size. The pupil is the black part in the center of the eye. It gets larger in dim light and smaller in bright light. Considerations Slight differences in pupil sizes are found in up to 1 in 5 healthy people. Most often, the diameter difference is less than 0.5 mm, but it can be up to 1 mm. Babies born with different sized pupils may not have any underlying disorder. If other family members also have similar pupils, then the pupil size difference could be genetic and is nothing to worry about. Also, for unknown reasons, pupils may temporarily differ in size. If there are no other symptoms and if the pupils return to normal, then it is nothing to worry about. Unequal pupil sizes of more than 1 mm that develop later in life and do not return to equal size may be a sign of an eye, brain, blood vessel, or nerve disease. Causes The use of eye drops is a common cause of a harmless change in pupil size. Other medicines that get in the eyes, including medicine from asthma inhalers, can change pupil size. Other causes of unequal pupil sizes may include: Aneurysm in the brain Bleeding inside the skull caused by head injury Brain tumor or abscess (such as pontine lesions) Excess pressure in one eye caused by glaucoma Increased intracranial pressure, because of brain swelling, intracranial hemorrhage, acute stroke, or intracranial tumor Infection of membranes around the brain ( meningitis or encephalitis ) Migraine headache Seizure (pupil size difference may remain long after seizure is over) Tumor, mass, or lymph node in the upper chest or lymph node causing pressure on a nerve may cause decreased sweating , a small pupil, or drooping eyelid all on the affected side (Horner syndrome) Stroke Injury to the carotid or vertebral artery Diabetic oculomotor nerve palsy Prior eye trauma, including surgery for cataracts Home Care Treatment depends on the cause of the unequal pupil size. You should see a health care provider if you have sudden changes that result in unequal pupil size. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact a provider if you have persistent, unexplained, or sudden changes in pupil size. If there is any recent change in pupil size, it may be a sign of a very serious condition. If you have differing pupil size after an eye or head injury, get medical help immediately. Always seek immediate medical attention if differing pupil size occurs along with: Blurred vision Double vision Droopy eyelid Eye sensitivity to light Fever Headache Loss of vision Nausea or vomiting Eye pain Stiff neck What to Expect at Your Office Visit Your provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions about your symptoms and medical history, including: Is this new for you or have your pupils ever been different sizes before? When did it start? Do you have other vision problems such as blurred vision, double vision, or light sensitivity? Do you have any loss of vision? Do you have eye pain? Do you have other symptoms such as headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, or stiff neck? Tests that may be done include: Blood tests such as CBC and blood differential Cerebrospinal fluid studies ( lumbar puncture ) CT scan of the head Electroencephalogram (EEG) Head MRI scan Tonometry (if glaucoma is suspected) X-rays of the neck Treatment depends on the cause of the problem.

An allergy shot is a medicine that is injected into your body to treat allergy symptoms. What are Allergy Shots? An allergy shot contains a small amount of an allergen . This is a substance that causes an allergic reaction. Examples of allergens include: Mold spores Dust mites Animal dander Pollen Insect venom Your health care provider gives you the shots for 3 to 5 years. This series of allergy shots may help reduce your allergy symptoms. Work with your provider to identify which allergens are causing your symptoms. This is often done through allergy skin testing or blood tests. Only the allergens you are allergic to are in your allergy shots. Allergy shots are only one part of an allergy treatment plan. You may also take allergy medicines while having allergy shots. Your provider may recommend that you reduce your exposure to allergens, as well. How do Allergy Shots Work? Allergy symptoms occur when your immune system tries to attack an allergen in your body. When this happens, your body creates mucus. This can cause bothersome symptoms in the nose, eyes, and lungs. Treatment with allergy shots is also called immunotherapy. When a small amount of an allergen is injected into your body, your immune system makes a substance called an antibody that blocks the allergen from causing symptoms. After several months of shots, some or all of your symptoms may be relieved. Relief can last several years. For some people, allergy shots can prevent new allergies and reduce asthma symptoms. Who can Benefit From Allergy Shots? You may benefit from allergy shots if you have: Asthma that allergies make worse Allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis Insect bite sensitivity Eczema , a skin condition that a dust mite allergy can make worse Allergy shots are effective for common allergens such as: Weed, ragweed, tree pollen Grass Mold or fungus Animal dander Dust mites Insect stings Cockroaches Adults (including the older people) as well as children 5 years and older can receive allergy shots. Your provider is not likely to recommend allergy shots for you if you: Have severe asthma. Have a heart condition. Take certain medicines, such as ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers. Are pregnant. Pregnant women should not begin allergy shots. But, they may be able to continue allergy shot treatment that was started before they became pregnant. Food allergies are not treated with allergy shots. Getting Your Allergy Shots You will get your allergy shots at your provider's office. They are usually given in the upper arm. The typical schedule is: For the first 3 to 6 months, you receive shots about 1 to 3 times a week. For the next 3 to 5 years, you receive the shots less often, about every 4 to 6 weeks. Keep in mind that many visits are needed to get the full effects of this treatment. Your provider will assess your symptoms now and then to help decide when you can stop receiving the shots. Side Effects An allergy shot may cause a reaction on the skin, such as redness, swelling, and itching. Some people have mild nasal stuffiness or a runny nose. Though rare, an allergy shot can also cause a severe life-threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis . Because of this, you may need to stay in your provider's office for 30 minutes after your shot to check for this reaction. You may also need to take an antihistamine or another medicine before your allergy shot appointments. This may prevent reactions to the shot at the injection site, but it does not prevent anaphylaxis. Reactions to allergy shots can be treated in your provider's office right away. When to Call the Doctor Contact your provider if you: Continue to have symptoms after several months of allergy shots Have questions or concerns about the allergy shots or your symptoms Have trouble keeping appointments for your allergy shots Alternative Names Allergy injections; Allergen immunotherapy References Dykewicz MS, Wallace DV, Amrol DJ, et al.

Advance care directives: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia Skip navigation An official website of the United States government Here’s how you know Here’s how you know Official websites use .gov A .gov website belongs to an official government

When you are very ill or injured, you may not be able to make health care choices for yourself. If you are unable to speak for yourself, your health care providers may be unclear as to what type of care you would prefer. Your family members may be uncertain or disagree about the type of medical care you should receive. An advance care directive is a legal document that tells your providers and others involved in helping you what care you agree to or decline in advance of this type of situation. Why Write an Advance Directive? With an advance care directive, you can tell your providers what medical treatment you do not want to have and what treatment you want no matter how ill you are. Writing an advance care directive may be difficult. You need to: Know and understand your treatment options. Decide future treatment options you may or may not want. Discuss your choices with your family. Living Wills A living will (advance care directive) explains the care you do or do not want. In it, you can state your wishes about receiving: CPR ( cardiopulmonary resuscitation ) if your breathing stops or your heart stops beating Feedings through a tube into a vein (IV) or into your stomach Extended care on a breathing machine Tests, medicines, or surgeries Blood transfusions Each state has laws about living wills. You can find out about the laws in your state from your providers, the state law organization, community social workers, and most hospitals. You should also know that: A living will does not deal with financial issues, and is not the same as a last will and testament after a person's death. You are not able to name someone to make health care decisions for you in a living will. Other Types of Advance Directives Other types of advance directives include: Special health care power of attorney is a legal document that allows you to name someone else ( a health care agent or proxy ) to make health care decisions for you when you cannot. It does not give power to anyone to make legal or financial decisions for you. A do-not-resuscitate order (DNR) is a document that tells providers not to do CPR if your breathing stops or your heart stops beating. Your provider talks to you, the proxy, or family about this choice. The provider writes the order on your medical chart. Fill out an organ donation authorization card and carry it in your wallet if you wish to be an organ donor after death. Keep a second card with your important papers. You can find out about organ donation from your provider. You can also have this choice listed on your driver's license. Verbal instructions are your choices about care that you tell providers or family members. Verbal wishes may supplement those you made previously in writing. It is best to avoid confusion by putting your wishes in writing whenever possible. Additional Information Write your living will or health care power of attorney according to your state's laws. Your attorney, provider, hospital or community social worker will be able to help you with proper documentation. Give copies to your family members, providers, and health care agent. Carry a copy with you in your wallet or the glove compartment of your car. Take a copy with you if you are in a hospital. Tell all medical staff involved in your care about these documents. You can change your decisions at any time. Be sure to tell everyone involved, family members, proxies, and providers, if you make changes to your advance directive or a living will is changed. Copy, save, and share the new documents with them.

Amylase is an enzyme that helps digest carbohydrates. It is made primarily in the pancreas and the glands that make saliva, and can be found at low levels in other parts of the body. When the pancreas is diseased or inflamed, it releases increased amounts of amylase into the blood. A test can be done to measure the level of this enzyme in your blood. Amylase may also be measured with a urine amylase test . How the Test is Performed A blood sample is taken from a vein. How to Prepare for the Test No special preparation is needed. However, you should avoid alcohol before the test. The health care provider may ask you to stop taking drugs that may affect the test. Do not stop taking any medicines without first talking to your provider. Drugs that can increase amylase measurements include: Asparaginase Aspirin Birth control pills Cholinergic medicines Ethacrynic acid Methyldopa Opiates (codeine, meperidine, and morphine) Thiazide diuretics How the Test will Feel You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted to draw blood. Afterward, there may be some throbbing. Why the Test is Performed This test is most often used to diagnose or monitor acute pancreatitis . It may also detect some digestive tract problems. The test may also be done for the following conditions: Chronic pancreatitis Pancreatic pseudocyst Normal Results The normal range is 40 to 140 units per liter (U/L) or 0.38 to 1.42 microkat/L (µkat/L). Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some laboratories use different measurement methods. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your test results. What Abnormal Results Mean Increased blood amylase level may occur due to: Acute pancreatitis Cancer of the pancreas , ovaries, or lungs Cholecystitis Infection of the salivary glands (such as mumps ) or a blockage of the salivary gland duct Intestinal blockage Macroamylasemia Pancreatic or bile duct blockage Perforated ulcer Tubal pregnancy (may have burst open) Viral hepatitis Decreased amylase level may occur due to: Bone fracture Congestive heart failure Damage to the pancreas with pancreatic scarring Gastrointestinal cancer Pregnancy Risks Slight risks from having blood drawn may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names Pancreatitis - blood amylase Images Blood test References Crockett SD, Wani S, Gardner TB, Falck-Ytter Y, Barkun AN; American Gastroenterological Association Institute Clinical Guidelines Committee.

To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript. If you have never given birth before, you may think you will just know when the time comes. In reality, it is not always easy to know when you are going into labor. The steps leading up to labor can drag on for days. Keep in mind that your due date is just a general idea of when your labor may start. Normal term labor can start any time between 3 weeks before and 2 weeks after this date. False Labor (Braxton Hicks Contractions) Most pregnant women feel mild contractions before true labor begins. These are called Braxton Hicks contractions, which: Are typically short Are not painful Do not come at regular intervals Are not accompanied by bleeding, leaking fluid, or decreased fetal movement This stage is called "prodromal" or "latent" labor. Other Signs That Labor is Near Lightening. This happens when your baby's head "drops" down into your pelvis. Your belly will look lower. It will be easier for you to breathe because the baby is not putting pressure on your lungs. You may need to urinate more often because the baby is pressing on your bladder. For first-time mothers, lightening often happens a few weeks before birth. For women who have had babies before, it may not happen until labor has begun. Bloody show. If you have bloody or brownish discharge from your vagina, it may mean your cervix has begun to dilate. The mucous plug that sealed your cervix during your pregnancy may be visible. This is a good sign. But active labor may still be days away. Your baby moves less. If you feel less movement, call your health care provider, as sometimes decreased movement can mean that the baby is in trouble. Your water breaks. When the amniotic sac (bag of fluid around the baby) breaks, you will feel fluid leak from your vagina. It may come out in a trickle or a gush. For most women, contractions come within 24 hours after the bag of water breaks. Even if contractions do not begin, let your provider know as soon as you think your water has broken. Diarrhea. Some women have the urge to go to the bathroom often to empty their bowels. If this happens and your stools are looser than normal, you may be going into labor. Nesting. There is no science behind the theory, but plenty of women feel the sudden urge to "nest" right before labor starts. If you feel the need to vacuum the entire house at 3 a.m., or finish your work in the baby's nursery, you may be getting ready for labor. True Labor In true labor, your contractions will: Come regularly and get closer together (about 5 to 10 minutes apart) Last from 30 to 70 seconds, and will get longer Not stop, no matter what you do Radiate (reach) into your lower back and upper belly Get stronger or become more intense as time goes on Make you unable to talk to other people or laugh at a joke When to Call the Doctor or Midwife Call your provider right away if you have: Leaking amniotic fluid Decreased fetal movement Any vaginal bleeding other than light spotting Regular, painful contractions every 5 to 10 minutes for 60 minutes Contractions lasting 60 to 90 seconds Call for any other reason if you are unsure what to do.

Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) describes several closely related disorders that disrupt the breakdown of certain fats. These disorders are often passed down (inherited) in families. Causes ALD is usually passed down from parent to child as an X-linked genetic trait . It affects mostly males. Some women who are carriers can have milder forms of the disease. It affects about 1 in 20,000 people from all races. Some cases of ALD occur when the gene changes on its own. This is called sporadic and is not inherited. The condition results in the buildup of very-long-chain fatty acids in the nervous system, adrenal gland, and testes. This disrupts normal activity in these parts of the body. There are three major categories of disease: Childhood cerebral form -- appears in mid-childhood (at ages 4 to 8) Adrenomyelopathy -- occurs in men in their 20s or later in life Impaired adrenal gland function (called Addison disease or Addison-like phenotype) -- adrenal gland does not produce enough steroid hormones Symptoms Childhood cerebral type symptoms include: Changes in muscle tone, especially muscle spasms and uncontrolled movements Crossed eyes Handwriting that gets worse Difficulty at school Difficulty understanding what people are saying Hearing loss Hyperactivity Worsening nervous system damage, including coma, decreased fine motor control, and paralysis Seizures Swallowing difficulties Visual impairment or blindness Adrenomyelopathy symptoms include: Difficulty controlling urination Possible worsening muscle weakness or leg stiffness Problems with thinking speed and visual memory Adrenal gland failure (Addison type) symptoms include: Coma Decreased appetite Increased skin color Loss of weight and muscle mass (wasting) Muscle weakness Vomiting Exams and Tests In most states, children will be screened for ALD as part of newborn screening tests. This is done with a heel stick to draw blood (as part of the routine screenings done on newborns). Newborn screening does not diagnose the condition, but it can help lead to early testing and diagnosis. Tests for this condition include: Blood levels of very long chain fatty acids and hormones that are produced by the adrenal gland Chromosome study to look for changes in the ABCD1 gene that may make the person more likely to develop a disease MRI of the head Skin biopsy Treatment Adrenal dysfunction may be treated with steroids (such as cortisol) if the adrenal gland is not producing enough hormones. A specific treatment for X-linked ALD is not available. A bone marrow transplant may stop worsening of the condition. Supportive care and careful monitoring of impaired adrenal gland function may help in improving comfort and quality of life. Support Groups More information and support for people with ALD and their families can be found at: National Organization for Rare Disorders -- rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/adrenoleukodystrophy/ NIH Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center -- rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/5758/x-linked-adrenoleukodystrophy Outlook (Prognosis) The childhood form of X-linked ALD is a progressive disease. It leads to a long-term coma (vegetative state) about 2 years after nervous system symptoms develop. The child can live in this condition for as long as 10 years until death occurs. The other forms of this disease are milder. Possible Complications These complications can occur: Adrenal crisis Vegetative state When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your health care provider if: Your child develops symptoms of X-linked ALD Your child has X-linked ALD and is getting worse Prevention Genetic counseling is recommended for couples with a family history of X-linked ALD. Mothers of affected sons have an 85% chance of being a carrier for this condition. Prenatal diagnosis of X-linked ALD is also available. It is done by testing cells from chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis . These tests look for either a known genetic change in the family or for very long chain fatty acid levels.

Adjustment disorder is a group of symptoms, such as stress, anxiety, feeling sad or hopeless, and physical symptoms that can occur after you go through a stressful life event. The symptoms occur because you are having a hard time coping. Your reaction is stronger than expected for the type of event that occurred. Causes Many different events may trigger symptoms of an adjustment disorder. Whatever the trigger is, the event may become too much for you. Stressors for people of any age include: Death of a loved one Divorce or problems with a relationship General life changes Illness or other health issues in yourself or a loved one Moving to a different home or a different city Unexpected catastrophes Worries about money Triggers of stress in teenagers and young adults may include: Family problems or conflict School problems Sexuality issues There is no way to predict which people who are affected by the same stress are likely to develop adjustment disorder. Your social skills before the event and how you have learned to deal with stress in the past may play roles. Symptoms Symptoms of adjustment disorder are often severe enough to affect work or social life. Symptoms include: Acting defiant or showing impulsive behavior Acting nervous or tense Crying, feeling sad or hopeless, and possibly withdrawing from other people Skipped heartbeats and other physical complaints Trembling or twitching To have adjustment disorder, you must have the following: The symptoms clearly come after a stressor, most often within 3 months The symptoms are more severe than would be expected There do not appear to be other disorders involved The symptoms are not part of normal grieving for the death of a loved one Sometimes, symptoms can be severe and the person may have thoughts of suicide or make a suicide attempt. Exams and Tests Your health care provider will do a mental health assessment to find out about your behavior and symptoms. You may be referred to a psychiatrist to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment The main goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and help you return to a similar level of functioning as before the stressful event occurred. Most mental health professionals recommend some type of talk therapy. This type of therapy can help you identify or change your responses to the stressors in your life. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of talk therapy. It can help you deal with your feelings: First the therapist helps you recognize the negative feelings and thoughts that occur. Then the therapist teaches you how to change these into helpful thoughts and healthy actions. Other types of therapy may include: Long-term therapy, where you will explore your thoughts and feelings over many months or more Family therapy, where you will meet with a therapist along with your family Self-help groups, where the support of others may help you get better Medicines may be used, but only along with talk therapy. These medicines may help if you are: Nervous or anxious most of the time Not sleeping very well Very sad or depressed Outlook (Prognosis) With the right help and support, you should get better quickly. The problem usually does not last longer than 6 months, unless the stressor continues to be present. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider for an appointment if you develop symptoms of adjustment disorder. If you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org . You can also call 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides free and confidential support 24/7, anytime day or night. You can also call 911 or the local emergency number or go to the hospital emergency room. DO NOT delay. If someone you know has attempted suicide, call 911 or the local emergency number right away. DO NOT leave the person alone, even after you have called for help.

Autoimmune hepatitis causes inflammation of the liver. It occurs when immune cells mistake the liver's normal cells for harmful invaders and attack them. Causes This form of hepatitis is an autoimmune disease . The body's immune system cannot tell the difference between healthy body tissue and harmful, outside substances. The result is an immune response that destroys normal body tissues. Liver inflammation, or hepatitis, may occur along with other autoimmune diseases. These include: Graves disease Inflammatory bowel disease Rheumatoid arthritis Scleroderma Sjögren syndrome Systemic lupus erythematosus Thyroiditis Type 1 diabetes Ulcerative colitis Autoimmune hepatitis may occur in family members of people with autoimmune diseases. There may be a genetic cause. This disease is most common in young girls and women. Symptoms Symptoms may include: Fatigue General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling ( malaise ) Itching Loss of appetite Nausea or vomiting Joint pain Pale or clay-colored stools Dark urine Abdominal distention Absence of menstruation (amenorrhea) may also be a symptom. Exams and Tests Tests for autoimmune hepatitis include the following blood tests: Liver function tests Anti-liver kidney microsome type 1 antibody (anti LKM-1) Anti-nuclear antibody ( ANA ) Anti-smooth muscle antibody (SMA) Serum IgG Liver biopsy to look for long-term hepatitis Treatment You may need prednisone or other corticosteroid medicines to help reduce the inflammation. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine are drugs used to treat other autoimmune disorders. They have also been shown to help people with autoimmune hepatitis. Some people may need a liver transplant. Outlook (Prognosis) The outcome varies. Corticosteroid medicines may slow the progress of the disease. However, autoimmune hepatitis may advance to cirrhosis. This could require a liver transplant. Possible Complications Complications may include: Cirrhosis Side effects from steroids and other medicines Hepatocellular carcinoma Liver failure Bleeding from varices Ascites Hepatic encephalopathy When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your health care provider if you notice symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis. Prevention In most cases, autoimmune hepatitis cannot be prevented. Knowing the risk factors may help you detect and treat the disease early.

Asherman syndrome is the formation of scar tissue in the uterine cavity. The problem most often develops after uterine surgery. Causes Asherman syndrome is a rare condition. In most cases, it occurs in women who have had several dilatation and curettage (D&C) procedures. A severe pelvic infection unrelated to surgery may also lead to Asherman syndrome. Adhesions in the uterine cavity can also form after infection with tuberculosis or schistosomiasis. These infections are rare in the United States. Uterine complications related to these infections are even less common. Symptoms The adhesions may cause: Amenorrhea (lack of menstrual periods) Repeated miscarriages Infertility However, such symptoms could be related to several conditions. They are more likely to indicate Asherman syndrome if they occur suddenly after a D&C or other uterine surgery. Exams and Tests A pelvic exam does not reveal problems in most cases. Tests may include: Hysterosalpingography Hysterosonogram Transvaginal ultrasound examination Hysteroscopy Blood tests or other laboratory examinations to detect tuberculosis or schistosomiasis Treatment Treatment involves surgery to cut and remove the adhesions or scar tissue. This can most often be done with hysteroscopy. This uses small instruments and a camera placed into the uterus through the cervix. After scar tissue is removed, the uterine cavity must be kept open while it heals to prevent adhesions from returning. Your health care provider may place a small balloon inside the uterus for several days. You may also need to take estrogen while the uterine lining heals. You may need to take antibiotics if there is an infection. Support Groups The stress of illness can often be helped by joining a support group. In such groups, members share common experiences and problems. Outlook (Prognosis) Asherman syndrome can often be cured with surgery. Sometimes more than one procedure will be necessary. Women who are infertile because of Asherman syndrome may be able to have a baby after treatment. Successful pregnancy depends on the severity of Asherman syndrome and the difficulty of the treatment. Other factors that affect fertility and pregnancy may also be involved. Possible Complications Complications of hysteroscopic surgery are uncommon. When they occur, they may include bleeding, perforation of the uterus, and pelvic infection. In some cases, treatment of Asherman syndrome will not cure infertility. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if: Your menstrual periods do not return after a gynecologic or obstetrical surgery. You cannot get pregnant after 6 to 12 months of trying (your provider may ask you to see a specialist for an infertility evaluation). Prevention Most cases of Asherman syndrome cannot be predicted or prevented.

An allergen is a substance that can cause an allergic reaction . In some people, the immune system recognizes allergens as foreign or dangerous. As a result, the immune system reacts by making a type of antibody called immunoglobulin E (IgE) to defend against the allergen. This reaction leads to allergy symptoms. Information Common allergens include: Animal proteins and animal dander Dust Drugs (such as antibiotics or medicines you put on your skin) Foods (such as egg, peanut, milk, nuts, soy, fish, animal meat, and wheat) Fungal spores Insect and mite feces Insect bites and stings (their venom) Natural latex rubber Pollen Patient Instructions Allergic rhinitis - what to ask your doctor - adult Allergic rhinitis - what to ask your doctor - child Images Positive reaction to allergen References Stewart GA, Robinson C.

Antidiarrheal drugs are used to treat loose, watery, and frequent stools. This article discusses overdose of antidiarrheal drugs containing diphenoxylate and atropine. Both ingredients help slow intestinal movement. In addition, atropine helps decrease the body's production of fluids. Other antidiarrheal drugs on the market contain different ingredients, such as loperamide. This article focuses on antidiarrheal drugs containing diphenoxylate and atropine specifically. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. Poisonous Ingredient The ingredients include: Diphenoxylate Atropine Diphenoxylate is a weak opioid, a class of drugs that includes morphine and other narcotics. Abuse of opioids, or use of opioids for nonmedical reasons is a growing problem . Where Found These substances are found in these medicines: Diphenatol Lofene Logen Lomanate Lomotil Lonox Lo-Trol Nor-Mil Other medicines may also contain these substances. Medicines containing diphenoxylate, such as Lomotil, are often confused with loperamide, a different drug which also contains an opioid ingredient. Symptoms Someone who has overdosed on this medicine may have some of these symptoms: Apathy (loss of desire to do anything) Slow breathing, or breathing stops Pounding or racing heartbeat (palpitations) Slowdown or stoppage of the bowels Coma (decreased level of consciousness, lack of responsiveness) Constipation Seizures (convulsions) Drowsiness Dry mucous membranes in the mouth Eye changes in pupil size (may be small, normal-sized, or large) Eyes move quickly from side to side Flushed skin Hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there) Restlessness Urination difficulty Vomiting Note: Symptoms may take up to 12 hours to appear. Home Care Seek medical help right away. DO NOT make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to. Before Calling Emergency Have this information ready: Person's age, weight, and condition Name of the product (ingredients and strength if known) Time it was swallowed Amount swallowed Poison Control Your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. What to Expect at the Emergency Room Take the prescription bottle with you to the hospital, if possible. The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated. The person may receive: Activated charcoal Oxygen Chest x-ray ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing) Intravenous fluids (given through a vein) Laxatives Tube through the nose into the stomach to empty the stomach ( gastric lavage ) Medicine to reverse the effect of atropine Medicine to reverse the effect of diphenoxylate Breathing support, including tube through the mouth and connected to a breathing machine (ventilator) Outlook (Prognosis) Most people will recover with treatment and are monitored for 24 hours. However, deaths may occur in young children. Children under age 6 should be admitted to the hospital and closely watched for 24 hours because signs of lung problems may be delayed and severe. Keep all medicines in child-proof containers and out of reach of children. Read all medicine labels and take only medicines that have been prescribed for you.

Athlete's foot is an infection of the feet caused by fungus. The medical term is tinea pedis or ringworm of the foot. Causes Athlete's foot occurs when a certain fungus grows on the skin of your feet. The same fungus may also grow on other parts of the body. However, the feet are most commonly affected, especially between the toes. Athlete's foot is the most common type of tinea infection. The fungus thrives in warm, moist areas. Your risk for getting athlete's foot increases if you: Wear closed shoes, especially if they are plastic-lined Keep your feet wet for long periods Sweat a lot Develop a minor skin or nail injury Athlete's foot is easily spread. It can be passed through direct contact or contact with items such as shoes, stockings, and shower or pool surfaces. Symptoms The most common symptom is cracked, flaking, peeling skin between the toes or on the side of the foot. Other symptoms can include: Red and itchy skin Burning or stinging pain Blisters that ooze or get crusty If the fungus spreads to your nails, they can become discolored, thick, and even crumble. Athlete's foot may occur at the same time as other fungal or yeast skin infections such as jock itch . Exams and Tests Your health care provider can diagnose athlete's foot simply by looking at your skin. If tests are needed, they may include: A simple office test called a KOH exam to check for fungus Skin culture A skin biopsy may also be performed with a special stain called PAS to identify fungus Treatment Over-the-counter antifungal powders or creams can help control the infection: These contain medicine such as miconazole, clotrimazole, terbinafine, or tolnaftate. Keep using the medicine for 1 to 2 weeks after the infection has cleared to prevent it from returning. In addition: Keep your feet clean and dry, especially between your toes. Wash your feet thoroughly with soap and water and dry the area carefully and completely. Try to do this at least twice a day. To widen and keep the web space (area between the toes) dry, use lamb's wool. This can be bought at a drugstore. Wear clean cotton socks. Change your socks and shoes as often as needed to keep your feet dry. Wear sandals or flip-flops at a public shower or pool. Use antifungal or drying powders to prevent athlete's foot if you tend to get it often, or you frequent places where athlete's foot fungus is common (like public showers). Wear shoes that are well-ventilated and made of natural material such as leather. It may help to alternate shoes each day, so they can completely dry between wearings. Do not wear plastic-lined shoes. If athlete's foot does not get better in 2 to 4 weeks with self-care, or frequently returns, see your provider. Your provider may prescribe: Antifungal medicines to take by mouth Antibiotics to treat bacterial infections that occur from scratching Topical creams that kill the fungus Outlook (Prognosis) Athlete's foot almost always responds well to self-care, although it may come back. Long-term medicine and preventive measures may be needed. The infection can spread to the toenails. When to Contact a Medical Professional Call your provider right away if: Your foot is swollen and warm to the touch, especially if there are red streaks or pain. These are signs of a possible bacterial infection. Other signs include pus, drainage, and fever. Athlete's foot symptoms do not go away within 2 to 4 weeks of self-care treatments.

Adult Still disease (ASD) is a rare illness that causes high fevers, rash, and joint pain. It may lead to long-term (chronic) arthritis. Adult Still disease is a severe version of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), which occurs in children. Adults can have the same condition, although it is much less common. It is also called adult-onset Still disease (AOSD). Causes Fewer than 1 out of 100,000 people develop ASD each year. It affects women more often than men. The cause of adult Still disease is unknown. No risk factors for the disease have been identified. Symptoms Almost all people with the disease will have fever, joint pain, sore throat, and a rash. Joint pain, warmth, and swelling are common. Most often, several joints are involved at the same time. Often, people with the condition have morning stiffness of joints that lasts for at least one hour. The fever comes on quickly once per day, most commonly in the afternoon or evening. The skin rash is often salmon-pink colored and comes and goes with the fever. Additional symptoms include: Abdominal pain and swelling Pain when taking a deep breath (pleurisy) Sore throat Swollen lymph nodes (glands) Weight loss The spleen or liver may become swollen. Lung and heart inflammation may also occur. Exams and Tests AOSD can only be diagnosed after many other diseases (such as infections and cancer) are ruled out. You may need many medical tests before a final diagnosis is made. A physical exam may show a fever, rash, and arthritis. The health care provider will use a stethoscope to listen for changes in the sound of your heart or lungs. The following blood tests can be helpful in diagnosing adult Still disease: Complete blood count (CBC), may show a high number of white blood cells (granulocytes) and reduced number of red blood cells. C-reactive protein (CRP), a measure of inflammation, will be higher than normal. ESR (sedimentation rate), a measure of inflammation, will be higher than normal. Ferritin level will be very high. Fibrinogen level will be high. Liver function tests will show high levels of AST and ALT . Rheumatoid factor and ANA test will be negative. Blood cultures and viral studies will be negative. Other tests may be needed to check for inflammation of the joints, chest, liver, and spleen: Abdominal ultrasound CT scan of the abdomen X-rays of the joints, chest, or stomach area (abdomen) Treatment The goal of treatment for adult Still disease is to control the symptoms of arthritis . Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, are most often used first. Prednisone may be used for more severe cases. If the disease is severe or persists for a long time (becomes chronic), medicines that suppress the immune system might be needed. Such medicines include: Methotrexate Anakinra (interleukin-1 receptor agonist) Tocilizumab (interleukin 6 inhibitor) Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists such as etanercept (Enbrel) Outlook (Prognosis) In many people, symptoms may come back several times over the next few years. Symptoms continue for a long time (chronic) in about one third of people with adult Still disease. Possible Complications A potentially life threatening complication of the disease, called macrophage activation syndrome, can be very severe with high fevers, severe illness and low blood cell counts. The bone marrow is involved and bone marrow biopsy is needed to make the diagnosis. Other complications may include: Arthritis in several joints Liver disease Pericarditis Pleural effusion Spleen enlargement When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have symptoms of adult Still disease. If you have already been diagnosed with the condition, you should call your provider if you have a cough or difficulty breathing . Prevention There is no known prevention.

Ammonium hydroxide is a colorless liquid chemical solution. It is in a class of substances called caustics. Ammonium hydroxide forms when ammonia dissolves in water. This article discusses poisoning from ammonium hydroxide. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. Poisonous Ingredient Ammonium hydroxide is poisonous. Where Found Ammonium hydroxide is found in many industrial products and cleaners. Some of these are flooring strippers, brick cleaners, and cements. Ammonium hydroxide can also release ammonia gas into the air. Ammonia alone (not ammonium hydroxide) can be found in many household items such as detergents, stain removers, bleaches, and dyes. The symptoms and treatment for ammonia exposure are similar to those for ammonium hydroxide. Other products may also contain ammonium hydroxide and ammonia. Ammonium hydroxide is used in the illegal production of methamphetamine. Symptoms Below are symptoms of ammonia exposure or poisoning in different parts of the body. AIRWAYS AND LUNGS Breathing difficulty (if the ammonia is inhaled) Coughing Throat swelling (can also cause breathing difficulty) Wheezing EYES, EARS, NOSE, AND THROAT Inability to swallow Severe pain in the throat Severe pain or burning in the nose, eyes, ears, lips, or tongue Vision loss ESOPHAGUS, STOMACH, AND INTESTINES Blood in the stool Burns of the esophagus (food pipe) and stomach Severe abdominal pain Vomiting, possibly with blood HEART AND BLOOD Collapse Low blood pressure (develops rapidly) Severe change in pH (too much or too little acid in the blood, which leads to damage in all of the body organs) SKIN Burns Holes in skin tissue Irritation Home Care Do not make the person throw up. If ammonium hydroxide is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes. If the person swallowed ammonium hydroxide, give them milk or water right away. You may also give them fruit juice. But, do not give anything to drink if they have symptoms that make it hard to swallow. These include vomiting, convulsions , or a decreased level of alertness . If the person breathed in fumes, move them to fresh air right away. Before Calling Emergency Have this information ready: The person's age, weight, and condition The name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known) The time it was inhaled, swallowed, or touched the skin The amount inhaled, swallowed, or on the skin Poison Control Your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. What to Expect at the Emergency Room Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible. Your health care provider will measure and monitor your vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. You may receive: Breathing support, including oxygen, tube through the mouth into the lungs, and breathing machine (ventilator) Blood and urine tests Bronchoscopy -- camera down the throat to view burns in the airways and lungs Chest x-ray ECG ( electrocardiogram ) Endoscopy -- camera down the throat to view burns in the esophagus and the stomach Fluids through a vein (IV) Medicines to treat symptoms Surgery to remove burned skin (debridement) Washing of the skin (irrigation), sometimes every few hours for several days You may need to stay in the hospital overnight. Outlook (Prognosis) Survival past 48 hours usually means the person will recover. If the chemical burned their eye, permanent blindness will probably occur in that eye. How well a person does depends on the strength of the chemical and how fast it was diluted and neutralized. Extensive damage to the mouth, throat, eyes, lungs, esophagus, nose, and stomach are possible. The ultimate outcome depends on how severe the damage is. If the chemical was swallowed, damage to the esophagus and stomach continues to occur for several weeks. Infection and holes (perforation) may result, and surgery may be needed. Some people won't recover and death can occur weeks or months later. Keep all cleaning materials, caustics, and poisons in their original containers and out of reach of children.

An abdominal CT scan is an imaging method. This test uses x-rays to create cross-sectional pictures of the belly area. CT stands for computed tomography. How the Test is Performed You will lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the CT scanner. Most often, you will lie on your back with your arms raised above your head. Once you are inside the scanner, the machine's x-ray beam rotates around you. Modern spiral scanners can perform the exam without stopping. A computer creates separate images of the belly area. These are called slices. These images can be stored, viewed on a monitor, printed on film or saved to a disk. Three-dimensional models of the belly area can be made by stacking the slices together. You must be still during the exam, because movement causes blurred images. You may be told to hold your breath for short periods of time. In many cases, an abdominal CT is done with a pelvis CT . The scan should take less than 30 minutes. How to Prepare for the Test You need to have a special dye, called contrast, put into your body before some exams. Contrast helps certain areas show up better on the scans. Contrast can be administered in various ways. Such as: Contrast can be given through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. If contrast is used, you may also be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test. You may have to drink the contrast before the exam. When you drink it will depend on the type of exam being done. Contrast has a chalky taste, although some are flavored so they taste a little better. The contrast you drink will pass out of your body through your stools and is harmless. Let your health care provider know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast. You may need to take medicines before the test to safely receive this substance. Before receiving the contrast, tell your provider if you take the diabetes medicine metformin (Glucophage). People taking this medicine may have to stop taking it for a while before the test. Let your provider know if you have any kidney problems. The IV contrast can worsen kidney function. Too much weight can damage the scanner. Find out if the CT machine has a weight limit if you weigh more than 300 pounds (135 kg). You will need to take off your jewelry and wear a hospital gown during the study. How the Test will Feel Lying on the hard table may be a bit uncomfortable. If you have contrast through a vein (IV), you may have: Slight burning sensation Metallic taste in the mouth Warm flushing of the body These feelings are normal and go away within a few seconds. Why the Test is Performed An abdominal CT scan makes detailed pictures of the structures inside your belly very quickly. This test may be used to look for: Cause of blood in the urine Cause of abdominal pain or swelling Cause of abnormal blood test results such as liver or kidney problems Hernia Cause of a fever Masses and tumors, including cancer Infections or injury Kidney stones Appendicitis What Abnormal Results Mean The abdominal CT scan may show some cancers, including: Cancer of the renal pelvis or ureter Colon cancer Hepatocellular carcinoma Lymphoma Melanoma Ovarian cancer Pancreatic cancer Pheochromocytoma Renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer) Spread of cancers that began outside the belly The abdominal CT scan may show problems with the gallbladder, liver, or pancreas, including: Acute cholecystitis Alcoholic liver disease Cholelithiasis Pancreatic abscess Pancreatic pseudocyst Pancreatitis Blockage of bile ducts The abdominal CT scan may reveal the following kidney problems: Blockage of the kidneys Hydronephrosis (kidney swelling from the backflow of urine) Kidney infection Kidney stones Kidney or ureter damage Polycystic kidney disease Abnormal results may also be due to: Abdominal aortic aneurysm Abscesses Appendicitis Bowel wall thickening Crohn disease Renal artery stenosis Renal vein thrombosis Risks Risks of CT scans include: Allergy to contrast dye Exposure to radiation Damage to kidney function from contrast dye CT scans expose you to more radiation than regular x-rays. Many x-rays or CT scans over time may increase your risk for cancer. However, the risk from any one scan is small. Most modern scanners are able to reduce the radiation exposure. Talk to your provider about this risk and the benefit of the test for getting a correct diagnosis of your medical problem. Some people have allergies to contrast dye. Let your provider know if you have ever had an allergic reaction to injected contrast dye. The most common type of contrast given into a vein contains iodine. If you have an iodine allergy, you may have nausea or vomiting , sneezing , itching , or hives if you get this type of contrast. If you must be given such contrast, your provider may give you antihistamines (such as Benadryl) or steroids before the test. Your kidneys help remove IV dye from the body. You may need extra fluids after the test to help flush the iodine out of your body if you have kidney disease or diabetes. Rarely, the dye may cause a life-threatening allergic response. Tell the scanner operator right away if you have any trouble breathing during the test. Scanners come with an intercom and speakers, so the operator can hear you at all times.

Aging changes in the male reproductive system may include changes in testicular tissue, sperm production, and erectile function. These changes usually occur gradually. Information Unlike women, men do not experience a major, rapid (over several months) change in fertility as they age (like menopause). Instead, changes occur gradually during a process that some people call andropause. Aging changes in the male reproductive system occur primarily in the testes . Testicular tissue mass decreases. The level of the male sex hormone, testosterone decreases gradually. There may be problems getting an erection. This is a general slowing, instead of a complete lack of function. FERTILITY The tubes that carry sperm may become less elastic (a process called sclerosis). The testes continue to produce sperm, but the rate of sperm cell production slows. The epididymis, seminal vesicles, and prostate gland lose some of their surface cells. But they continue to produce the fluid that helps carry sperm. URINARY FUNCTION The prostate gland enlarges with age as some of the prostate tissue is replaced with a scar like tissue. This condition, called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), affects about 50% of men. BPH may cause problems with slowed urination and ejaculation. In both men and women, reproductive system changes are closely related to changes in the urinary system. EFFECT OF CHANGES Fertility varies from man to man. Age does not predict male fertility. Prostate function does not affect fertility. A man can father children, even if his prostate gland has been removed. Some fairly old men can (and do) father children. The volume of fluid ejaculated usually remains the same, but there are fewer living sperm in the fluid. Some men may have a lower sex drive (libido). Sexual responses may become slower and less intense. This may be related to a decreased testosterone level. It may also result from psychological or social changes due to aging (such as the lack of a willing partner), illness, long-term ( chronic ) conditions, or medicines. Aging by itself does not prevent a man from being able to enjoy sexual relationships. COMMON PROBLEMS Erectile dysfunction (ED) may be a concern for aging men. It is normal for erections to occur less often than when a man was younger. Aging men are often less able to have repeated ejaculations. ED is most often the result of a medical problem, rather than simple aging. Ninety percent of ED is believed to be caused by a medical problem instead of a psychological problem. Medicines (such as those used to treat hypertension and certain other conditions) can prevent a man from getting or keeping enough of an erection for intercourse. Disorders, such as diabetes , can also cause ED. ED that is caused by medicines or illness is often successfully treated. Talk to your primary health care provider or a urologist if you are concerned about this condition. BPH may eventually interfere with urination. The enlarged prostate partially blocks the tube that drains the bladder (urethra). Changes in the prostate gland make older men more likely to have urinary tract infections . Urine may back up into the kidneys (vesicoureteral reflux) if the bladder is not fully drained. If this is not treated, it can eventually lead to kidney failure . Prostate gland infections or inflammation ( prostatitis ) may also occur. Prostate cancer becomes more likely as men age. It is one of the most common causes of cancer death in men. Bladder cancer also becomes more common with age. Testicular cancers are possible, but these occur more often in younger men. PREVENTION Many physical age-related changes, such as prostate enlargement or testicular atrophy, are not preventable. Getting treated for health disorders such as high blood pressure and diabetes may prevent problems with urinary and sexual function. Changes in sexual response are most often related to factors other than simple aging. Older men are more likely to have good sex if they continue to be sexually active during middle age.

An abdominal abscess is a pocket of infected fluid and pus located inside the belly (abdominal cavity). This type of abscess can be located near or inside the liver, pancreas, kidneys or other organs. There can be one or more abscesses. Causes You can get abdominal abscesses because you have: A burst appendix A burst or leaking intestine A burst ovary A perforated diverticulum, most often in the sigmoid colon Inflammatory bowel disease Infection in your gallbladder, pancreas, ovary or other organs Pelvic infection Parasite infection You are more at risk for an abdominal abscess if you have: Trauma Perforated ulcer disease Surgery in your belly area Weakened immune system Germs may pass through your blood to an organ in your belly. Sometimes, no reason can be found for an abscess. Symptoms Pain or discomfort in the belly that does not go away is a common symptom. This pain: May be found only in one area of your belly or over most of your belly May be sharp or dull May become worse over time Depending on where the abscess is located, you may have: Pain in your back Pain in your chest or shoulder Other symptoms of an abdominal abscess may be a lot like symptoms of having the flu. You may have: Swollen belly Diarrhea Fever or chills Lack of appetite and possible weight loss Nausea or vomiting Weakness Cough Exams and Tests Your symptoms can be a sign of many different problems. Your health care provider will do some tests to help determine if you have an abdominal abscess. These may include the following tests: Complete blood count -- A high white blood cell count is a possible sign of an abscess of other infection. Comprehensive metabolic panel -- This will show any liver, kidney or blood problems. Other tests that should show abdominal abscesses include: Abdominal x-ray Ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis MRI of the abdomen and pelvis Treatment Your health care team will try to identify and treat the cause of the abscess. Your abscess will be treated with antibiotics, drainage of the pus, or both. At first, you will likely receive care in the hospital. ANTIBIOTICS You will be given antibiotics to treat the abscess. You will take them for up to 4 to 6 weeks. You will start on IV antibiotics in the hospital and you may receive IV antibiotics at home. You then may change to pills. Be sure you take all of your antibiotics, even if you feel better. DRAINAGE Your abscess needs to be drained of pus. Your provider and you will decide the best way to do this. Using a needle and drain -- Your provider puts a needle through the skin and into the abscess. Usually, this is done with the help of x-rays to make sure the needle is inserted into the abscess. Your provider will give you medicine to make you sleepy, and medicine to numb the skin before the needle is inserted into the skin. A sample of the abscess will be sent to the lab. This helps your provider choose which antibiotics to use. A drain is left in the abscess so that pus can drain out. Usually, the drain is kept in for days or weeks until the abscess gets better. Having surgery -- Sometimes, a surgeon does surgery to clean out the abscess. You will be put under general anesthesia so that you are asleep for the surgery . Surgery may be needed if: Your abscess cannot be reached safely using a needle through the skin Your appendix, intestines, or another organ has burst The surgeon will make a cut into the belly area. Laparotomy involves a larger cut. Laparoscopy uses a very small cut and a laparoscope (a tiny video camera). The surgeon will then: Clean and drain the abscess. Put a drain into the abscess. The drain stays in until the abscess gets better. Outlook (Prognosis) How well you respond to treatment depends on the cause of the abscess and how bad the infection is. It also depends on your overall health. Usually, antibiotics and drainage takes care of abdominal abscesses that have not spread. You may need more than one operation. Sometimes, an abscess will come back. Possible Complications Complications may include: The abscess may not drain fully. The abscess may come back (recur). The abscess may cause severe illness and a bloodstream infection. The infection could spread.

An anterior cruciate ligament injury is the over-stretching or tearing of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in the knee. A tear may be partial or complete. Considerations The knee joint is located where the end of the thigh bone (femur) meets the top of the shin bone (tibia). Four main ligaments connect these two bones: Medial collateral ligament (MCL) runs along the inside of the knee. It prevents the knee from bending inward. Lateral collateral ligament (LCL) runs along the outside of the knee. It prevents the knee from bending outward. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is in the middle of the knee. It prevents the shin bone from sliding out in front of the thigh bone. Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) works with the ACL. It prevents the shin bone from sliding backward under the femur. Women are more likely to have an ACL tear than men. Causes An ACL injury can occur if you: Get hit very hard on the side of your knee, such as during a football tackle Overextending your knee joint Quickly stop moving and change direction while running, landing from a jump, or turning Basketball, football, soccer, and skiing are common sports linked to ACL tears. ACL injuries often occur with other injuries. For example, an ACL tear often occurs along with tears to the MCL and the shock-absorbing cartilage in the knee (meniscus). Most ACL tears occur in the middle of the ligament, or the ligament is pulled off the thigh bone. These injuries form a gap between the torn edges, and do not heal on their own. Symptoms Early symptoms: A "popping" sound at the time of injury Obvious knee swelling within 6 hours of injury Pain, especially when you try to put weight on the injured leg Difficulty in continuing with your sport Feeling of instability Those who have only a mild injury may notice that the knee feels unstable or seems to "give way" when using it. First Aid See your health care provider if you think you have an ACL injury. Do not play sports or other activities until you have seen a provider and have been treated. Your provider may send you for an MRI of the knee. This can confirm the diagnosis. It may also show other knee injuries. First aid for an ACL injury may include: Raising your leg above the level of the heart Putting ice on the knee Pain relievers, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen) You also may need: Crutches to walk until the swelling and pain get better Brace to give your knee some stability Physical therapy to help improve joint motion and leg strength Surgery to reconstruct the ACL Some people can live and function normally with a torn ACL. However, most people complain that their knee is unstable and may "give out" with physical activity. Unstable knee after ACL tears can lead to further knee damage. You are also less likely to return to the same level of sports without the ACL. DO NOT Do NOT move your knee if you have had a serious injury. Use a splint to keep the knee straight until you see a doctor. Do NOT return to play or other activities until you have been treated. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider right away if you have a serious knee injury. Get immediate medical attention if the foot is cool and blue after a knee injury. This means that the knee joint may be dislocated, and blood vessels to the foot may be injured. This is a medical emergency. Prevention Use proper techniques when playing sports or exercising. Some college sports programs teach athletes how to reduce stress placed on the ACL. This involves a series of warm up exercises and jumping drills. There are jumping and landing exercises that have been shown to reduce ACL injuries. The use of knee braces during vigorous athletic activity (such as football) is controversial. It has not been shown to reduce the number of knee injuries, but not specifically ACL injuries.

You had an angioplasty done when you were in the hospital. You may have also had a stent (a tiny wire mesh tube) placed in the blocked area to keep it open. Both of these were done to open a narrowed or blocked artery that supplies blood to your brain. Your health care provider inserted a catheter (flexible tube) into an artery through an incision (cut) in your groin or your arm. Your provider used live x-rays to carefully guide the catheter up to the area of the blockage in your carotid artery. Then your provider passed a guide wire through the catheter to the blockage. A balloon catheter was pushed over the guide wire and into the blockage. The tiny balloon on the end was inflated. This opened the blocked artery. Then your provider may have inserted a stent to keep the artery open. What to Expect at Home You should be able to do most of your normal activities within a few days, but take it easy. Self-care If your provider put the catheter in through your groin: Walking short distances on a flat surface is ok. Limit going up and down stairs to about 2 times a day for the first 2 to 3 days. Do not do yard work, drive, or play sports for at least 2 days, or for the number of days your provider tells you to wait. You will need to care for your incision. Your provider will tell you how often to change your dressing (bandage). You need to take care that the incision site does not become infected. If you have pain or other signs of infection, call your provider. If your incision bleeds or swells, lie down and put pressure on it for 30 minutes. If the bleeding or swelling does not stop or gets worse, call your provider and return to the hospital. Or, go to the closest emergency room, or call 911 or the local emergency number right away. If bleeding or swelling are severe even before 30 minutes have passed, call 911 or the local emergency number right away. DO NOT delay. Having carotid artery surgery does not cure the cause of the blockage in your arteries. Your arteries may become narrow again. To lower your chances of this happening: Eat healthy foods, exercise (if your provider advises you to), stop smoking (if you smoke), and reduce your stress level. Do not drink alcohol in excess. Take medicine to help lower your cholesterol if your provider prescribes it. If you are taking medicines for blood pressure or diabetes, take them the way you have been told to take them. Your provider may ask you to take aspirin and/or another medicine called clopidogrel (Plavix) , or another medicine, when you go home. These medicines keep your blood from forming clots in your arteries and in the stent. DO NOT stop taking them without talking with your provider first. When to Call the Doctor Contact your provider if: You have a headache, become confused, or have numbness or weakness in any part of your body. You have problems with your eyesight or you cannot talk normally. There is bleeding at the catheter insertion site that does not stop when pressure is applied. There is swelling at the catheter site. Your leg or arm below where the catheter was inserted changes color or becomes cool to touch, pale, or numb. The small incision from your catheter becomes red or painful, or yellow or green discharge is draining from it. Your legs are swelling. You have chest pain or shortness of breath that does not go away with rest. You have dizziness, fainting, or you are very tired. You are coughing up blood or yellow or green mucus. You have chills or a fever over 101°F (38.3°C).

Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening type of allergic reaction . Causes Anaphylaxis is a severe, whole-body allergic reaction to a chemical that has become an allergen . An allergen is a substance that can cause an allergic reaction. After being exposed to a substance such as bee sting venom, the person's immune system becomes sensitized to it. When the person is exposed to that allergen again, an allergic reaction may occur. Anaphylaxis happens quickly after the exposure. The condition is severe and involves the whole body. Tissues in different parts of the body release histamine and other substances. This causes the airways to tighten and leads to other symptoms. Some drugs (morphine, x-ray dye, aspirin, and others) may cause an anaphylactic-like reaction (anaphylactoid reaction) when people are first exposed to them. These reactions are not the same as the immune system response that occurs with true anaphylaxis. But, the symptoms, risk of complications, and treatment are the same for both types of reactions. Anaphylaxis can occur in response to any allergen. Common causes include: Drug allergies Food allergies Insect bites/stings Pollen and other inhaled allergens rarely cause anaphylaxis. Some people have an anaphylactic reaction with no known cause. Anaphylaxis is life threatening and can occur at any time. Risks include a history of any type of allergic reaction. Symptoms Symptoms develop quickly, often within seconds or minutes. They may include any of the following: Abdominal pain Feeling anxious Chest discomfort or tightness Diarrhea Difficulty breathing, coughing, wheezing, or high-pitched breathing sounds Difficulty swallowing Dizziness or lightheadedness Hives , itchiness, redness of the skin Nasal congestion Nausea or vomiting Palpitations Slurred speech Swelling of the face, eyes, or tongue Unconsciousness Exams and Tests The health care provider will examine the person and ask about what might have caused the condition. Tests for the allergen that caused anaphylaxis (if the cause is not obvious) may be done after treatment. Treatment Anaphylaxis is an emergency condition that needs medical attention right away. Call 911 or the local emergency number immediately. Check the person's airway, breathing, and circulation, which are known as the ABC's of Basic Life Support. A warning sign of dangerous throat swelling is a very hoarse or whispered voice, or coarse sounds when the person is breathing in air. If necessary, begin rescue breathing and CPR . Call 911 or the local emergency number. Calm and reassure the person. If the allergic reaction is from a bee sting, scrape the stinger off the skin with something firm (such as a fingernail or plastic credit card). Do not use tweezers. Squeezing the stinger will release more venom. If the person has emergency allergy medicine on hand, help the person take or inject it. Do not give medicine through the mouth if the person is having difficulty breathing. Take steps to prevent shock . Have the person lie flat, raise the person's feet about 12 inches (30 centimeters), and cover the person with a coat or blanket. Do not place the person in this position if a head, neck, back, or leg injury is suspected, or if it causes discomfort. DO NOT: Do not assume that any allergy shots the person has already received will provide complete protection. Do not place a pillow under the person's head if they are having trouble breathing. This can block the airways. Do not give the person anything by mouth if they are having trouble breathing. Paramedics or other providers may place a tube through the nose or mouth into the airways. Or emergency surgery will be done to place a tube directly into the trachea . The person may receive medicines to further reduce symptoms. Outlook (Prognosis) Anaphylaxis can be life threatening without prompt treatment. Symptoms usually do get better with the right therapy, so it is important to act right away. Possible Complications Without prompt treatment, anaphylaxis may result in: Blocked airway Cardiac arrest (no effective heartbeat) Respiratory arrest (no breathing) Shock When to Contact a Medical Professional Call 911 or the local emergency number if you or someone you know develops severe symptoms of anaphylaxis. Or, go to the nearest emergency room. Prevention To prevent allergic reactions and anaphylaxis: Avoid triggers such as foods and medicines that have caused an allergic reaction in the past. Ask detailed questions about ingredients when you are eating away from home. Also carefully examine ingredient labels. If you have a child who is allergic to certain foods, introduce one new food at a time in small amounts so you can recognize an allergic reaction. People who know that they have had serious allergic reactions should wear a medical ID tag. If you have a history of serious allergic reactions, carry emergency medicines (such as a chewable antihistamine and injectable epinephrine or a bee sting kit) according to your provider's instructions. Do not use your injectable epinephrine on anyone else. They may have a condition (such as a heart problem) that could be worsened by this drug.

Aortic regurgitation is a heart valve disease in which the aortic valve does not close tightly. This allows blood to flow from the aorta (the largest blood vessel) into the left ventricle (a chamber of the heart). Causes Any condition that prevents the aortic valve from closing completely can cause this problem. When the valve does not close all the way, some blood comes back each time the heart beats. When a large amount of blood comes back, the heart must work harder to force out enough blood to meet the body's needs. The left lower chamber (left ventricle) of the heart widens (dilates) and the heart beats very strongly ( bounding pulse ). Over time, the heart becomes less able to supply enough blood to the body. In the past, rheumatic fever was the main cause of aortic regurgitation. The use of antibiotics to treat strep infections has made rheumatic fever less common. Therefore, aortic regurgitation is more commonly due to other causes. These include: Ankylosing spondylitis Aortic dissection Congenital (present at birth) valve problems, such as bicuspid valve Endocarditis (infection of the heart valves) High blood pressure Marfan syndrome Reiter syndrome (also known as reactive arthritis) Syphilis Systemic lupus erythematosus Trauma to the chest Aortic insufficiency is most common in men between the ages of 30 and 60. Symptoms The condition often has no symptoms for many years. Symptoms may come on slowly or suddenly. They may include: Bounding pulse Chest pain similar to angina (rare) Fainting Fatigue Palpitations (sensation of the heart beating) Shortness of breath with activity or when lying down Waking up short of breath after falling asleep Swelling of the feet, legs, or abdomen Uneven, rapid, racing, pounding, or fluttering pulse Weakness that is more likely to occur with activity Exams and Tests Signs may include: Heart murmur that can be heard through a stethoscope Very forceful beating of the heart Bobbing of the head in time with the heartbeat Hard pulses in the arms and legs Low diastolic blood pressure Signs of fluid in the lungs Aortic regurgitation may be seen on tests such as: Aortic angiography Echocardiogram -- ultrasound examination of the heart Left heart catheterization MRI or CT scan of the heart Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) or transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) A chest x-ray may show swelling of the left lower heart chamber. Lab tests cannot diagnose aortic insufficiency. However, they may help check for other causes of symptoms. Treatment You may not need treatment if you have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. However, you will need to see a health care provider for regular exams and echocardiograms. Diuretics (water pills) or other types of medicines may be prescribed for symptoms of heart failure. In the past, most people with heart valve problems were given antibiotics before dental work or an invasive procedure, such as colonoscopy. The antibiotics were given to prevent an infection of the damaged heart. However, antibiotics are now used much less often. You may need to limit activity that requires more work from your heart. Talk to your provider. Surgery to repair or replace the aortic valve corrects aortic regurgitation. The decision to have aortic valve replacement depends on your symptoms and the condition and function of your heart. There is increasing interest in a minimally invasive procedure in which a replacement valve is implanted via catheter. This is similar to a procedure traditionally done in people with aortic stenosis. This option may become more common in the future. You may also need surgery to repair the aorta if it is enlarged. Outlook (Prognosis) Surgery can cure aortic insufficiency and relieve symptoms, unless you develop heart failure or other complications. People with angina or congestive heart failure due to aortic regurgitation do poorly without treatment. Possible Complications Complications may include: Abnormal heart rhythms Heart failure Infection in the heart When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if: You have symptoms of aortic regurgitation. You have aortic insufficiency and your symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop (especially chest pain, difficulty breathing , or swelling ). Prevention Blood pressure control is very important if you are at risk for aortic regurgitation.

Absent pulmonary valve is a rare defect in which the pulmonary valve is either missing or poorly formed. Oxygen-poor blood flows through this valve from the heart to the lungs, where it picks up fresh oxygen. This condition is present at birth (congenital). Causes Absent pulmonary valve occurs when the pulmonary valve does not form or develop properly while the baby is in the mother's womb. When present, it often occurs as part of a heart condition called tetralogy of Fallot . It is found in about 3% to 6% of people who have tetralogy of Fallot. When the pulmonary valve is missing or does not work well, blood does not flow efficiently to the lungs to get enough oxygen. In most cases, there is also a hole between the left and right ventricles of the heart ( ventricular septal defect ). This defect will also lead to low-oxygen blood being pumped out to the body. The skin will have a blue appearance (cyanosis), because the body's blood contains a low amount of oxygen. Absent pulmonary valve also results in very enlarged (dilated) branch pulmonary arteries (the arteries that carry blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen). They can become so enlarged that they press on the tubes that bring the oxygen into the lungs (bronchi). This causes breathing problems. Other heart defects that can occur with absent pulmonary valve include: Abnormal tricuspid valve Atrial septal defect Double outlet right ventricle Ductus arteriosis Endocardial cushion defect Marfan syndrome Tricuspid atresia Absent left pulmonary artery Heart problems that occur with absent pulmonary valve may be due to defects in certain genes. Symptoms Symptoms can vary depending on which other defects the infant has, but may include: Blue coloring to the skin (cyanosis) Coughing Failure to thrive Poor appetite Rapid breathing Respiratory failure Wheezing Exams and Tests Absent pulmonary valve may be diagnosed before the baby is born with a test that uses sound waves to create an image of the heart (echocardiogram). During an exam, the health care provider may hear a murmur in the infant's chest. Tests for absent pulmonary valve include: Heart CT scan Chest x-ray Echocardiogram Electrocardiogram (ECG) test to measure the electrical activity of the heart Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart Treatment Infants who have respiratory symptoms typically need surgery early. Infants without severe symptoms most often have surgery within the first 3 to 6 months of life or later. Depending on the type of other heart defects the infant has, surgery may involve: Closing the hole in the wall between the left and right ventricles of the heart (ventricular septal defect) Closing a blood vessel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery (ductus arteriosis) Enlarging the flow from the right ventricle to the lungs Types of surgery for absent pulmonary valve include: Moving the pulmonary artery to the front of the aorta and away from the airways Rebuilding the artery wall in the lungs to reduce pressure on the airways (pulmonary plication and reduction arterioplasty) Rebuilding the windpipe and breathing tubes to the lungs Replacing the abnormal pulmonary valve with one taken from human or animal tissue Infants with severe breathing symptoms may need to get oxygen or be placed on a breathing machine (ventilator) before and after surgery. Outlook (Prognosis) Without surgery, there may be a risk for serious consequences. In many cases, surgery can treat the condition and relieve symptoms. Outcomes are most often very good. Possible Complications Complications may include: Brain infection (abscess) Lung collapse (atelectasis) Pneumonia Right-sided heart failure Stroke When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if your infant has symptoms of absent pulmonary valve. If you have a family history of heart defects, talk to your provider before or during pregnancy. Prevention Although there is no way to prevent this condition, families may be evaluated to determine their risk for congenital defects.

Angioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to your legs. Fatty deposits can build up inside the arteries and block blood flow. A stent is a small, metal mesh tube that keeps the artery open. Angioplasty and stent placement are two ways to open blocked peripheral arteries. When You're in the Hospital You had a procedure that used a balloon catheter to open a narrowed vessel (angioplasty) that supplies blood to the arms or legs (peripheral artery). You may have also had a stent placed. To perform the procedure: Your doctor inserted a catheter (flexible tube) into your blocked artery through a cut in your groin. X-rays were used to guide the catheter up to the area of the blockage. The doctor then passed a wire through the catheter to the blockage and a balloon catheter was pushed over it. The balloon on the end of the catheter was blown up. This opened the blocked vessel and restored proper blood flow to the affected area. A stent is very often placed at the site to prevent the vessel from closing up again. What to Expect at Home The cut in your groin may be sore for several days. You should be able to walk farther now without needing to rest, but you should take it easy at first. It may take 6 to 8 weeks to recover fully. Your leg on the side of the procedure may be swollen for a few days or weeks. This will improve as the blood flow to the limb becomes normal. Self-care You will need to increase your activity slowly while the incision heals. Walking short distances on a flat surface is OK. Try to walk a little bit 3 or 4 times a day. Slowly increase how far you walk each time. Limit going up and down stairs to about 2 times a day for the first 2 to 3 days. Do not do yard work, drive, or play sports for at least 2 days, or for the number of days your health care provider tells you to wait. You will need to care for your incision. Your provider will tell you how often to change your dressing. If your incision bleeds or swells up, lie down and put pressure on it for 30 minutes. If the bleeding or swelling does not stop or gets worse, contact your provider and return to the hospital or else go to the closest emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number. When you are resting, try to keep your legs raised above the level of your heart. Place pillows or blankets under your legs to raise them. Angioplasty does not cure the cause of blockage in your arteries. Your arteries may become narrow again. To lower your chances of this happening: Eat a heart-healthy diet , exercise, stop smoking (if you smoke), and reduce your stress level. Take medicine to help lower your cholesterol if your provider prescribes it. If you are taking medicines for blood pressure or diabetes, take them the way your provider has asked you to take them. Your provider may recommend that you take aspirin or another medicine, called clopidogrel (Plavix), when you go home. These medicines keep blood clots from forming in your arteries and in the stent. Do not stop taking them without talking with your provider first. When to Call the Doctor Contact your provider if: There is swelling at the catheter site. There is bleeding at the catheter insertion site that does not stop when pressure is applied. Your leg below where the catheter was inserted changes color or becomes cool to the touch, pale, or numb. The small incision from your catheter becomes red or painful, or yellow or green discharge is draining from it. Your legs are swelling excessively. You have chest pain or shortness of breath that does not go away with rest. You have dizziness, fainting, or you are very tired. You are coughing up blood or yellow or green mucus. You have chills or a fever over 101°F (38.3°C). You develop weakness in your body, your speech is slurred, or you are unable to get out of bed.

Your child had surgery to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is a condition that causes acid, food, or liquid to come up from the stomach into the esophagus. The esophagus is the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. Now that your child is going home, follow the surgeon's instructions on how to care for your child at home. Use the information below as a reminder. When Your Child Was in the Hospital During the operation, the surgeon wrapped the upper part of your child's stomach around the end of the esophagus. The surgery was done in one of these ways: Through an incision (cut) in your child's upper belly (open surgery) With a laparoscope (a thin tube with a tiny camera on the end) through small incisions By endoluminal repair (like a laparoscope, but the surgeon goes in through the mouth) Your child may also have had a pyloroplasty. This is a procedure that widened the opening between the stomach and small intestine. The doctor may have also placed a G-tube (gastrostomy tube) in the child's stomach for feeding. What to Expect at Home Most children can go back to school or daycare as soon as they feel well enough and when the surgeon feels it is safe. Your child should avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activity, such as gym class and very active play, for 3 to 4 weeks. You may ask your child's surgeon for a letter to give to the school nurse and teachers to explain restrictions your child has. Your child may have a feeling of tightness when swallowing. This is from the swelling inside your child's esophagus. Your child may also have some bloating. These should go away in 6 to 8 weeks. Recovery is faster from laparoscopic surgery than from open surgery. You will need to schedule a follow-up appointment with your child's primary care provider or gastroenterologist and with the surgeon after the surgery. Care at Home You'll help your child get back to a regular diet over time. Your child should have started on a liquid diet in the hospital. After the doctor feels your child is ready, you can add soft foods. Once your child is taking soft foods well, talk with your child's doctor about returning to a regular diet. If your child had a gastrostomy tube (G-tube) placed during surgery, it can be used for feeding and venting. Venting is when the G-tube is opened to release air from the stomach, similar to burping. The nurse in the hospital should have shown you how to vent, care for, and replace the G-tube, and how to order G-tube supplies. Follow instructions on G-tube care. If you need help with the G-tube at home, contact either your surgeon, primary care provider, or the home health care nurse who works for the G-tube supplier. For pain, you can give your child over-the-counter pain medicines such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin). If your child is still having pain, call your child's provider. Wound Care If sutures (stitches), staples, or glue were used to close your child's skin: You may remove the external dressings (bandages) and allow your child to take a brief shower the day after surgery unless your surgeon tells you differently. Butterfly strips or glue should be left in place and not removed until your surgeon says it is OK. If taking a shower isn't possible, you can give your child a sponge bath. If strips of tape were used to close your child's skin: Cover the incisions with plastic wrap before showering for the first week. Tape the edges of the plastic carefully to keep water out. Do not try to wash the tape off. They will fall off after about a week. Do not allow your child to soak in a bathtub or hot tub or go swimming until your child's surgeon tells you it is OK. When to Call the Doctor Contact your child's provider if your child has: A fever of 101°F (38.3°C) or higher Incisions that are bleeding, red, warm to the touch, or have a thick, yellow, green, or milky drainage A swollen or painful belly Nausea or vomiting for more than 24 hours Problems swallowing that keep your child from eating Problems swallowing that do not go away after 2 or 3 weeks Pain that pain medicine is not helping Trouble breathing A cough that does not go away Any problems that make your child unable to eat If the G-tube is accidentally removed or falls out Alternative Names Fundoplication - children - discharge; Nissen fundoplication - children - discharge; Belsey (Mark IV) fundoplication - children - discharge; Toupet fundoplication - children - discharge; Thal fundoplication - children - discharge; Hiatal hernia repair - children - discharge; Endoluminal fundoplication - children - discharge References Holcomb GW.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder. It often appears in the first 2 to 3 years of life. ASD affects the brain's ability to develop normal social and communication skills. Causes The exact cause of ASD isn't known. It's likely that a number of factors may lead to ASD. Research shows that genes may be involved, since ASD runs in some families. Certain medicines taken during pregnancy may also lead to ASD in the child. Other causes have been suspected, but not proven. Some scientists believe that damage to a part of the brain, called the amygdala, may be involved. Others are looking at whether a virus may trigger symptoms. Some parents have heard that vaccines may cause ASD. But studies have found no link between vaccines and ASD. All expert medical and government groups state that there is no link between vaccines and ASD. The increase in children with ASD may be due to better diagnosis and newer definitions of ASD. Autism spectrum disorder now includes syndromes that used to be regarded as separate disorders: Autistic disorder Asperger syndrome Childhood disintegrative disorder Pervasive developmental disorder Symptoms Most parents of children with ASD suspect that something is wrong by the time the child is 18 months old. Children with ASD often have problems with: Pretend play Social interactions Verbal and nonverbal communication Some children seem normal before age 1 or 2. They then suddenly lose language or social skills they already had. Symptoms can vary from moderate to severe. A person with ASD may: Be very sensitive to sight, hearing, touch, smell, or taste (for example, they refuse to wear "itchy" clothes and get upset if they're forced to wear the clothes) Be very upset when routines are changed Repeat body movements over and over Be unusually attached to things Communication problems may include: Can't start or maintain a conversation Uses gestures instead of words Develops language slowly or not at all Doesn't adjust gaze to look at objects that others are looking at Doesn't refer to self the right way (for example, says "you want water" when the child means "I want water") Doesn't point to show other people objects (normally occurs in the first 14 months of life) Repeats words or memorized passages, such as commercials Social interaction problems may include: Doesn't make friends Doesn't play interactive games Is withdrawn May not respond to eye contact or smiles, or may avoid eye contact May treat others as objects Prefers to be alone rather than with others Isn't able to show empathy Response to sensory information problems may include: Doesn't startle at loud noises Has very high or very low senses of sight, hearing, touch, smell, or taste May find normal noises painful and hold their hands over their ears May withdraw from physical contact because it's too stimulating or overwhelming Rubs surfaces, mouths or licks objects May have a very high or very low response to pain Problems with play may include: Doesn't imitate the actions of others Prefers solitary or ritualistic play Shows little pretend or imaginative play Behaviors may include: Acts out with intense tantrums Gets stuck on a single topic or task Has a short attention span Has very narrow interests Is overactive or very passive Is aggressive toward others or self Shows a strong need for things being the same Repeats body movements Exams and Tests All children should have routine exams done by their health care provider. More tests may be needed if the provider or parents are concerned. This is true if a child doesn't meet any one of these language milestones: Babbling by 12 months Gesturing (pointing, waving bye-bye) by 12 months Saying single words by 16 months Saying two-word spontaneous phrases by 24 months (not just echoing) Losing any language or social skills at any age These children might need a hearing test, blood lead test, and screening test for ASD. A provider experienced in diagnosing and treating ASD should see the child to make the actual diagnosis. Because there isn't a definitive test for ASD, diagnosis is often based on guidelines from a medical book titled Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) . An evaluation for ASD often includes a complete physical and nervous system (neurologic) exam. Tests may be done to see if there is a problem with genes or the body's metabolism . Metabolism is the body's physical and chemical processes. ASD includes a broad spectrum of symptoms. So, a single, brief evaluation can't tell a child's true abilities. It's best to have a team of specialists to evaluate the child. They might evaluate: Communication Language Motor skills Speech Success at school Thinking abilities Some parents don't want to have their child diagnosed because they're afraid the child will be labeled. But without a diagnosis, their child may not get the needed treatment and services. Treatment At this time, there is no cure for ASD. A treatment program will greatly improve the outlook for most young children. Most programs build on the interests of the child in a highly structured schedule of constructive activities. Treatment plans may combine techniques, including: Applied behavior analysis (ABA) Medicines, if needed Occupational therapy Physical therapy Speech-language therapy APPLIED BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS (ABA) This program is for younger children. It helps in some cases. ABA uses one-on-one teaching that reinforces various skills. The goal is to get the child close to normal functioning for their age. An ABA program is often done in a child's home. A behavioral psychologist oversees the program. ABA programs can be very expensive and aren't widely used by school systems. Parents often have to find funding and staffing from other sources, which aren't available in many communities. TEACCH Another program is called the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH). It uses picture schedules and other visual cues. These help children work on their own and organize and structure their environments. Though TEACCH tries to improve a child's skills and ability to adapt, it also accepts the problems associated with ASD. Unlike ABA programs, TEACCH doesn't expect children to achieve typical development with treatment. MEDICINES There is no medicine that treats ASD itself. But medicines are often used to treat behavior or emotional problems that people with ASD may have. These include: Aggression Anxiety Attention problems Extreme compulsions that the child cannot stop Hyperactivity Impulsiveness Irritability Mood swings Outbursts Sleep difficulty Tantrums The drug risperidone is FDA approved to treat children ages 5 through 16 for the irritability and aggression that can occur with ASD. The drug aripriprazole is FDA approved to treat children ages 6 through 17 for the same symptoms. Other medicines that may also be used are mood stabilizers and stimulants. DIET Some children with ASD seem to do well on a gluten-free or casein-free diet. Gluten is in foods containing wheat, rye, and barley. Casein is in milk, cheese, and other dairy products. Not all experts agree that changes in diet make a difference. And not all studies have shown positive results. If you're thinking about these or other diet changes, talk to both a provider and a registered dietitian. You want to be sure that your child is still getting enough calories and the right nutrients. OTHER APPROACHES Beware of widely publicized treatments for ASD that don't have scientific support, and reports of miracle cures. If your child has ASD, talk with other parents. Also discuss your concerns with ASD specialists. Follow the progress of ASD research, which is rapidly developing. Support Groups Many organizations provide additional information and help on ASD. Outlook (Prognosis) With the right treatment, many ASD symptoms can be improved. Most people with ASD have some symptoms throughout their lives. But, they're able to live with their families or in the community. Possible Complications ASD can be linked with other brain disorders, such as: Fragile X syndrome Intellectual disability Tuberous sclerosis Some people with autism develop seizures. The stress of dealing with autism can lead to social and emotional problems for families and caregivers, and for the person with autism. When to Contact a Medical Professional Parents usually suspect that there is a developmental problem long before a diagnosis is made. Call your provider if you think that your child is not developing normally.

An acoustic neuroma is a slow-growing tumor of the nerve that connects the ear to the brain. This nerve is called the vestibular cochlear nerve. It is behind the ear, right under the brain. An acoustic neuroma is a benign tumor. This means that it does not spread to other parts of the body. However, it can damage several important nearby nerves as it grows. Causes Acoustic neuromas have been linked with the genetic disorder neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Acoustic neuromas are uncommon. Symptoms The symptoms vary, based on the size and location of the tumor. Because the tumor grows so slowly, symptoms most often start after age 30. Common symptoms include: Abnormal feeling of movement ( vertigo ) Hearing loss in the affected ear that makes it hard to hear conversations Ringing ( tinnitus ) in the affected ear Less common symptoms include: Difficulty understanding speech Dizziness Headache Loss of balance Numbness in the face or one ear Pain in the face or one ear Weakness of the face or facial asymmetry Exams and Tests The health care provider may suspect an acoustic neuroma based on your medical history, an exam of your nervous system, or tests. Often, the physical exam is normal when the tumor is diagnosed. Sometimes, the following signs may be present: Decreased feeling on one side of the face Drooping on one side of the face Unsteady walk The most useful test to identify an acoustic neuroma is an MRI of the brain . Other tests to diagnose the tumor and tell it apart from other causes of dizziness or vertigo include: Hearing test Test of equilibrium and balance ( electronystagmography ) Test of hearing and brainstem function (brainstem auditory evoked response) Treatment Treatment depends on the size and location of the tumor, your age, and your overall health. You and your provider must decide whether to watch the tumor without treatment, use radiation treatment to stop it from growing, or try to remove it. Many acoustic neuromas are small and grow very slowly. Small tumors with few or no symptoms may be watched for changes, especially in older people. Regular MRI scans will be done. If not treated, some acoustic neuromas can: Damage the nerves involved in hearing and balance Place pressure on nearby brain tissue Harm the nerves responsible for movement and feeling in the face Lead to a buildup of fluid ( hydrocephalus ) in the brain (with very large tumors) Removing an acoustic neuroma is more commonly done for: Larger tumors Tumors that are causing symptoms Tumors that are growing quickly Tumors that are pressing on the brain Surgery or a type of radiation treatment is done to remove the tumor and prevent other nerve damage. Depending on the type of surgery performed, hearing can sometimes be preserved. The surgical technique to remove an acoustic neuroma is called microsurgery. A special microscope and small, precise instruments are used. This technique offers a higher chance of cure. Stereotactic radiosurgery focuses high-powered x-rays on a small area. It is a form of radiation therapy, not a surgical procedure. It may be used to slow down or stop the growth of tumors that are hard to remove with surgery. It may also be done to treat people who are unable to have surgery, such as older adults or people who are very sick. Removing an acoustic neuroma can damage the acoustic or other nerves. This may cause loss of hearing or weakness in the face muscles. This damage is more likely to occur when the tumor is large. Outlook (Prognosis) An acoustic neuroma is not cancer. The tumor does not spread to other parts of the body. However, it may continue to grow and press on structures in the skull. People with small, slow-growing tumors may not need treatment. Hearing loss present before treatment is not likely to return after surgery or radiosurgery. In cases of smaller tumors, hearing loss that occurs after surgery may return. Most people with small tumors will have no permanent weakness of the face after surgery. However, people with large tumors are more likely to have some permanent weakness of the face after surgery. Signs of nerve damage such as loss of hearing or weakness of the face may be delayed after radiosurgery. In most cases, brain surgery can completely remove the tumor.

Anti-reflux surgery is a treatment for acid reflux, also known as GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). GERD is a condition in which food or stomach acid comes back up from your stomach into the esophagus. The esophagus is the tube from your mouth to the stomach. Reflux often occurs if the muscles where the esophagus meets the stomach do not close tightly enough. A hiatal hernia can make GERD symptoms worse. It occurs when the stomach bulges through this opening into your chest. Symptoms of reflux or heartburn are burning in the stomach that you may also feel in your throat or chest, burping or gas bubbles, or trouble swallowing food or fluids. Description The most common procedure of this type is called fundoplication. In this surgery, your surgeon will: First repair the hiatal hernia, if one is present. This involves tightening the opening in your diaphragm with stitches to keep your stomach from bulging upward through the opening in the muscle wall. Some surgeons place a piece of mesh in the repaired area to make it more secure. Wrap the upper part of your stomach around the end of your esophagus with stitches. The stitches create pressure at the end of your esophagus, which helps prevent stomach acid and food from flowing up from the stomach into the esophagus. Surgery is done while you are under general anesthesia, so you are asleep and pain-free. Surgery most often takes 2 to 3 hours. Your surgeon may choose from different techniques. OPEN REPAIR Your surgeon will make 1 large surgical cut in your belly. A tube may be inserted into your stomach through the abdomen to keep the stomach wall in place. This tube will be taken out in about a week. LAPAROSCOPIC REPAIR Your surgeon will make 3 to 5 small cuts in your belly. A thin tube with a tiny camera on the end is inserted through one of these cuts. Surgical tools are inserted through the other cuts. The laparoscope is connected to a video monitor in the operating room. Your surgeon does the repair while viewing the inside of your belly on the monitor. Your surgeon may need to switch to an open procedure in case of problems. ENDOLUMINAL FUNDOPLICATION This is a new procedure that can be done without making cuts. A special camera on a flexible tool (endoscope) is passed down through your mouth and into your esophagus. Using this tool, the surgeon will put small clips in place at the point where the esophagus meets the stomach. These clips help prevent food or stomach acid from backing up. Why the Procedure is Performed Before surgery is considered, your health care provider will have you try: Medicines such as H2 blockers or PPIs (proton pump inhibitors) Lifestyle changes Surgery to treat your heartburn or reflux symptoms may be recommended when: Your symptoms do not get much better when you use medicines. You do not want to keep taking these medicines. You have more severe problems in your esophagus, such as scarring or narrowing, ulcers, or bleeding. You have reflux disease that is causing aspiration pneumonia, a chronic cough, or hoarseness. Anti-reflux surgery is also used to treat a problem where part of your stomach is getting stuck in your chest or is twisted. This is called a para-esophageal hernia. Risks Risks of any anesthesia and surgery in general are: Reactions to medicines Breathing problems Bleeding , blood clots, or infections Risks of this surgery are: Damage to the stomach, esophagus, liver, or small intestine. This is very rare. Gas bloat. This is when the stomach overfills with air or food and you are unable to relieve the pressure by burping or vomiting. These symptoms slowly get better for most people. Pain and difficulty when you swallow. This is called dysphagia. In most people, this goes away during the first 3 months after surgery. Return of the hiatal hernia or reflux. Before the Procedure You may need the following tests: Blood tests ( complete blood count , electrolytes , or liver tests). Esophageal manometry (to measure pressures in the esophagus) or pH monitoring (to see how much stomach acid is coming back into your esophagus). Upper endoscopy. Almost all people who have this anti-reflux surgery have already had this test. If you have not had this test, you will need to have it. X-rays of the esophagus. Always tell your provider if: You could be pregnant. You are taking any medicines, or supplements or herbs you bought without a prescription. Before your surgery: You may need to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), vitamin E, clopidogrel (Plavix), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other medicines or supplements that affect blood clotting several days before surgery. Ask your surgeon what you should do. Ask your provider which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery. On the day of your surgery: Follow your surgeon's instructions about when to stop eating and drinking. Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water. Follow instructions for showering before surgery. Your surgeon will tell you when to arrive at the hospital. Be sure to arrive on time. After the Procedure Most people who have laparoscopic surgery can leave the hospital within 1 to 3 days after the procedure. You may need a hospital stay of 2 to 6 days if you have open surgery. Most people can return to normal activities in 4 to 6 weeks. Outlook (Prognosis) Heartburn and other symptoms should improve after surgery. Some people still need to take medicines for heartburn after surgery. You may need another surgery in the future if you develop new reflux symptoms or swallowing problems. This may happen if your stomach was wrapped around your esophagus too tightly, the wrap loosens, or a new hiatal hernia develops.

Acute nephritic syndrome is a group of symptoms that occur with some disorders that cause swelling and inflammation of the glomeruli in the kidney, or glomerulonephritis . Causes Acute nephritic syndrome is often caused by an immune response triggered by an infection or other disease. Common causes in children and adolescents include: Hemolytic uremic syndrome (disorder that occurs when an infection in the digestive system produces toxic substances that destroy red blood cells and cause kidney injury) Henoch-Schönlein purpura (disease that involves purple spots on the skin, joint pain, gastrointestinal problems and glomerulonephritis) IgA nephropathy (disorder in which antibodies called IgA build up in kidney tissue) Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (kidney disorder that occurs after infection with certain strains of streptococcus bacteria) Common causes in adults include: Abdominal abscesses Goodpasture syndrome (also called anti-glomerular basement membrane disease in which the immune system attacks the glomerular basement membrane) Hepatitis B or C Endocarditis (inflammation of the inside lining of the heart chambers and heart valves caused by a bacterial or fungal infection) Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (disorder that involves inflammation and changes to kidney cells) Rapidly progressive (crescentic) glomerulonephritis (a form of glomerulonephritis that leads to a rapid loss of kidney function) Lupus nephritis (kidney complication of systemic lupus erythematosus ) Vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels) Viral diseases such as mononucleosis , measles , and mumps The inflammation affects the function of the glomerulus. This is the part of the kidney that filters blood to make urine and remove waste. As a result, blood and protein appear in the urine, and excess fluid builds up in the body. Swelling of the body occurs when the blood loses a protein called albumin. Albumin keeps fluid in the blood vessels. When it is lost, fluid collects in the body tissues. Blood loss from the damaged kidney structures leads to blood in the urine. Symptoms Common symptoms of nephritic syndrome are: Blood in the urine (urine appears dark, tea-colored, or cloudy) Decreased urine output (little or no urine may be produced) Swelling of the face, eye socket, legs, arms, hands, feet, abdomen, or other areas High blood pressure Other symptoms that may occur include: Blurred vision, usually from burst blood vessels in the retina of the eye Cough containing mucus or pink, frothy material from fluid buildup in the lungs Shortness of breath, from fluid buildup in the lungs General ill feeling (malaise), drowsiness , confusion, aches and pains, headache Symptoms of acute kidney failure or long-term (chronic) kidney disease may develop. Exams and Tests During an examination, your health care provider may find the following signs: High blood pressure Abnormal heart and lung sounds Signs of excess fluid (edema) such as swelling in the legs, arms, face, and belly Enlarged liver Enlarged veins in the neck Tests that may be done include: Blood electrolytes Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Creatinine Creatinine clearance Urine protein Urinalysis A kidney biopsy will show inflammation of the glomeruli, which may indicate the cause of the condition. Tests to find the cause of acute nephritic syndrome may include: ANA titer for lupus Antiglomerular basement membrane antibody Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody for vasculitis (ANCA) Blood culture Culture of the throat or skin Serum complement (C3 and C4) Treatment The goal of treatment is to reduce inflammation in the kidney and control high blood pressure. You may need to stay in a hospital to be diagnosed and treated. Your provider may recommend: Bedrest until you feel better with treatment A diet that limits salt, fluids, and potassium Medicines to control high blood pressure, reduce inflammation, or to remove fluid from your body Kidney dialysis , if needed Outlook (Prognosis) The outlook depends on the disease that is causing the nephritis. When the condition improves, symptoms of fluid retention (such as swelling and cough) and high blood pressure may go away in 1 or 2 weeks. Urine tests may take months to return to normal. Children tend to do better than adults and usually recover completely. Only rarely do they develop complications or progress to chronic glomerulonephritis and chronic kidney disease. Adults do not recover as well or as quickly as children. Although it is unusual for the disease to return, in some adults, the disease does return and they will develop end-stage kidney disease and may need dialysis or a kidney transplant . When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have symptoms of acute nephritic syndrome. Prevention Often, the disorder cannot be prevented, although treatment of illness and infection may help to reduce the risk.

Open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is surgery to fix a widened part in your aorta. This is called an aneurysm . The aorta is the large artery that carries blood from your heart to your belly (abdomen), pelvis, and legs. An aortic aneurysm is when part of this artery becomes too large or balloons outward. Description The surgery will take place in an operating room. You will be given general anesthesia (you will be asleep and pain-free). Your surgeon opens up your belly and replaces the aortic aneurysm with a man-made, cloth-like material. Here is how it can be done: In one approach, you will lie on your back. The surgeon will make a cut in the middle of your belly, from just below the breastbone to below the belly button. Rarely, the cut goes across the belly. In another approach, you will lie slightly tilted on your right side. The surgeon will make a 5- to 6-inch (13 to 15 centimeters) cut from the left side of your belly, ending a little below your belly button. Your surgeon will replace the aneurysm with a long tube made of man-made (synthetic) cloth. It is sewn in with stitches. In some cases, the ends of this tube (or graft) will be moved through blood vessels in each groin and attached to those in the leg. Once the surgery is done, your legs will be examined to make sure that there is a pulse. Most often a dye test using x-rays is done to confirm that there is good blood flow to the legs. The cut is closed with sutures or staples. Surgery for aortic aneurysm replacement may take 2 to 4 hours. Most people recover in the intensive care unit (ICU) after the surgery. Why the Procedure is Performed Open surgery to repair an AAA is sometimes done as an emergency procedure when there is bleeding inside your body from the aneurysm. You may have an AAA that is not causing any symptoms or problems. Your health care provider may have found the problem after you had an ultrasound or CT scan done for another reason. There is a risk that this aneurysm may suddenly break open (rupture) if you do not have surgery to repair it. However, surgery to repair the aneurysm may also be risky, depending on your overall health. You and your provider must decide whether the risk of having this surgery is smaller than the risk for rupture. Surgery is more likely to be suggested if the aneurysm is: Larger (about 2 inches or 5 centimeters) Growing more quickly (a little less than 1/4 inch over the last 6 to 12 months) Risks The risks for this surgery are higher if you have: Heart disease Kidney failure Lung disease Past stroke Other serious medical problems Complications are also higher for older people. Risks for any surgery are: Blood clots in the legs that may travel to the lungs Breathing problems Heart attack or stroke Infection, including in the lungs ( pneumonia ), urinary tract, and belly Reactions to medicines Risks for this surgery are: Bleeding before or after surgery Damage to a nerve, causing pain or numbness in the leg Damage to your intestines or other nearby organs Loss of blood supply to a portion of the large intestine causing delayed bleeding in the stool Infection of the graft Injury to the ureter, the tube that carries urine from your kidneys to your bladder Kidney failure that may be permanent Lower sex drive or inability to get an erection Poor blood supply to your legs, your kidneys, or other organs Spinal cord injury Wound breaks open Wound infections Death Before the Procedure Your will have a physical exam and get tests before you have surgery. Always tell your provider what medicines you are taking, even drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription. If you are a smoker, you should stop smoking at least 4 weeks before your surgery. Your provider can help. During the 2 weeks before your surgery: You will have visits with your provider to make sure medical problems such as diabetes , high blood pressure , and heart or lung problems are well treated. You may be asked to stop taking drugs that make it harder for your blood to clot. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), clopidogrel (Plavix), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and other drugs like these. Ask which drugs you should still take on the day of your surgery. Always tell your provider if you have a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness before your surgery. DO NOT drink anything after midnight the day before your surgery, including water. On the day of your surgery: Take the drugs you were told to take with a small sip of water. You will be told when to arrive at the hospital. After the Procedure Most people stay in the hospital for 5 to 10 days. During a hospital stay, you will: Be in the intensive care unit (ICU), where you will be monitored very closely right after surgery. You may need a breathing machine during the first day. Have a urinary catheter . Have a tube that goes through your nose into your stomach to help drain fluids for 1 or 2 days. You will then slowly begin drinking, then eating. Receive medicine to keep your blood thin. Be encouraged to sit on the side of the bed and then walk. Wear special stockings to prevent blood clots in your legs. Be asked to use a breathing machine to help clear your lungs. Receive pain medicine into your veins or into the space that surrounds your spinal cord (epidural). Outlook (Prognosis) Full recovery for open surgery to repair an aortic aneurysm may take 2 or 3 months. Most people make a full recovery from this surgery. Most people who have an aneurysm repaired before it breaks open (ruptures) have a good outlook.

Amitriptyline hydrochloride is a type of prescription medicine called a tricyclic antidepressant. It is used to treat depression. Amitriptyline hydrochloride overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine. This can be by accident or on purpose. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with has an overdose , call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. Poisonous Ingredient Amitriptyline can be harmful in large amounts. Where Found Amitriptyline hydrochloride is a prescription medicine. It is sold under these brand names: Adepril Emitrip Enovil Trepiline Tryptanol Vanatrip Other medicines may also contain amitriptyline hydrochloride. Symptoms Below are symptoms of an amitriptyline hydrochloride overdose in different parts of the body. These symptoms may occur more often or be more severe in people who also take certain other medicines that affect serotonin, a chemical in the brain. AIRWAYS AND LUNGS Slowed, labored breathing BLADDER AND KIDNEYS Cannot urinate Urine does not flow easily EYES, EARS, NOSE, AND THROAT Blurred vision Dilated (wide) pupils Eye pain in people at risk for a type of glaucoma Dry mouth HEART AND BLOOD Irregular heart rate Low blood pressure Rapid heartbeat Shock NERVOUS SYSTEM Agitation Coma Seizures Drowsiness Hallucinations Headache Inability to concentrate Lack of alertness ( stupor ) Muscle rigidity or stiffness of the limbs Restlessness Uncoordinated movement STOMACH AND INTESTINES Constipation Vomiting Home Care This can be a very serious overdose. Seek medical help right away. Do not make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to. Before Calling Emergency Have this information ready: Person's age, weight, and condition Name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known) Time it was swallowed Amount swallowed If the medicine was prescribed for the person Poison Control Your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. What to Expect at the Emergency Room Take the container to the hospital with you, if possible. The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Tests that may be done include: Blood and urine tests CT scan Chest x-ray Electrocardiogram (ECG) Treatment may include: Fluids through a vein (by IV) Medicine called an antidote to reverse the effects of the poison and treat symptoms, such as sodium bicarbonate or lidocaine Activated charcoal Laxatives Breathing support, including a tube through the mouth into the lungs and connected to a breathing machine (ventilator) Outlook (Prognosis) An amitriptyline hydrochloride overdose can be very serious. People who swallow too much of this medicine are almost always admitted to the hospital. How well someone does depends on how much of the medicine was swallowed and how quickly treatment is given. The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance of recovery. Complications such as heart rhythm disturbances, pneumonia, muscle damage from lying on a hard surface for a long period of time, or brain damage from lack of oxygen may result in permanent disability. Death can occur. Alternative Names Elavil overdose; Adepril overdose; Endep overdose; Enovil overdose; Trepiline overdose References Aronson JK. Tricyclic antidepressants. In: Aronson JK, ed.

Abdominal rigidity is stiffness of the muscles in the belly area, which can be felt when touched or pressed. Considerations When there is a sore area inside the belly or abdomen, the pain will often get worse when a hand presses against your belly area. Your fear or nervousness about being touched (palpated) may cause your abdominal muscles to stiffen, but there should be no pain. If you have pain when you are touched and you tighten the muscles to guard against more pain, it is more likely caused by a physical condition inside your body. The condition may affect one or both sides of your body. Abdominal rigidity may occur with: Abdominal tenderness Nausea Pain Swelling Vomiting Causes Causes can include: Abscess inside the abdomen Appendicitis Cholecystitis caused by gallstones Hole that develops through the entire wall of the stomach, small intestine, large bowel, or gallbladder ( gastrointestinal perforation ) Injury to the abdomen Peritonitis When to Contact a Medical Professional Get medical care right away if you have pain when the belly is gently pressed and then released. What to Expect at Your Office Visit You will probably be seen in an emergency room. The health care provider will examine you. This may include a pelvic exam, and possibly a rectal exam. The provider will ask questions about your symptoms, such as: When did they first start? What other symptoms do you have at the same time? For example, do you have abdominal pain ? You may have the following tests: Abdominal and pelvic CT scan Abdominal and pelvic ultrasound Blood tests Colonoscopy Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) Paracentesis Sigmoidoscopy Stool analysis Urine tests X-rays of the chest or abdomen You will probably not be given any pain relievers until a diagnosis is made. Pain relievers can hide your symptoms. Alternative Names Rigidity of the abdomen References Ball JW, Dains JE, Flynn JA, Solomon BS, Stewart RW. Abdomen.

Anthrax blood test: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia Skip navigation An official website of the United States government Here’s how you know Here’s how you know Official websites use .gov A .gov website belongs to an official government

The anthrax blood test is used to measure substances (proteins) called antibodies , which are produced by the body in reaction to the bacteria that cause anthrax . How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed . How to Prepare for the Test There is no special preparation. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed This test may be performed when the health care provider suspects you have anthrax infection. The bacteria that cause anthrax is called Bacillus anthracis . Normal Results A normal result means no antibodies to the anthrax bacteria were seen in your blood sample. However, during the early stages of infection, your body may only produce a few antibodies, which the blood test may miss. The test may need to be repeated in 10 days to 2 weeks. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean An abnormal result means antibodies to the bacteria have been detected and you may have anthrax disease. But some people come in contact with the bacteria and do not develop the disease. To determine if you have a current infection, your provider will look for an increase in the antibody count after a few weeks as well as your symptoms and physical exam findings. Risks There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Multiple punctures to locate veins Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Considerations The best test for diagnosing anthrax is a culture of affected tissue or blood.

Most of the time, your urine is sterile. This means there are no bacteria growing. On the other hand, if you have symptoms of a bladder or kidney infection , bacteria will often be present and growing in your urine. Sometimes, your health care provider may check your urine for bacteria, even when you do not have any symptoms. If enough bacteria are found in your urine, you have asymptomatic bacteriuria. Causes Asymptomatic bacteriuria occurs in a small number of healthy people. It affects women more often than men. The reasons for the lack of symptoms are not well understood. You are more likely to have this problem if you: Have a urinary catheter in place Are female Are pregnant Are sexually active (in females) Have long-term diabetes and are female Are an older adult Have recently had a surgical procedure in your urinary tract Symptoms There are no symptoms of this problem. If you have these symptoms, you may have a urinary tract infection, but you do not have asymptomatic bacteriuria. Burning during urination Increased urgency to urinate Increased frequency of urination Exams and Tests To diagnose asymptomatic bacteriuria, a urine sample must be sent for a urine culture . Most people with no urinary tract symptoms do not need this test. You may need a urine culture done as a screening test, even without symptoms, if: You are pregnant You have a surgery or procedure planned that involves the bladder, prostate, or other parts of the urinary tract To make the diagnosis of asymptomatic bacteriuria, the culture must show a large growth of bacteria. In men, only one culture needs to show growth of bacteria In women, two different cultures must show growth of bacteria Treatment Most people who have bacteria growing in their urine, but no symptoms, do not need treatment. This is because the bacteria are not causing any harm. In fact, treating most people with this problem may make it harder to treat infections in the future. However, for some people getting a urinary tract infection is more likely or may cause more severe problems. As a result, treatment with antibiotics may be needed if: You are pregnant. You recently had a kidney transplant. You are scheduled for surgery involving the prostate gland or the bladder. You have kidney stones that have caused an infection. Your young child has reflux (backward movement of urine from the bladder into ureters or kidneys). Without symptoms being present, even people who are older adults, have diabetes, or have a catheter in place do not need treatment. Possible Complications If it is not treated, you may have a kidney infection if you are at high risk. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have: Difficulty emptying your bladder Fever Flank or back pain Pain with urination You will need to be checked for a bladder or kidney infection.

Ankle replacement is surgery to replace the damaged bone and cartilage in the ankle joint. Artificial joint parts (prosthetics) are used to replace your own bones. There are different types of ankle replacement surgeries. Description Ankle replacement surgery is most often done while you are under general anesthesia. This means you will be asleep and not feel the pain. You may have spinal anesthesia. You can be awake but will not feel anything below your waist. If you have spinal anesthesia, you will also be given medicine to help you relax during the operation. Your surgeon will make a surgical cut in the front of your ankle to expose the ankle joint. Your surgeon will then gently push the tendons, nerves, and blood vessels to the side. After this, your surgeon will remove the damaged bone and cartilage. Your surgeon will remove the damaged part of: The lower end of your shin bone (tibia). The top of your foot bone (talus) that the leg bones rest on. The metal parts of the new artificial joint are then attached to the cut bony surfaces. A special glue/bone cement may be used to hold them in place. A piece of plastic is inserted between the two metal parts. Screws may be placed to stabilize your ankle. The surgeon will put the tendons back into place and close the wound with sutures (stitches). You may need to wear a splint, cast, or brace for a while to keep the ankle from moving. You will also be instructed to not put weight on the leg until the implant has healed into the ankle. Why the Procedure is Performed This surgery may be done if the ankle joint is badly damaged. Your symptoms may be pain and loss of movement of the ankle. Some causes of damage are: Arthritis caused by ankle injuries or surgery in the past Bone fracture Infection Osteoarthritis Osteonecrosis Rheumatoid arthritis Tumor You may not be able to have a total ankle replacement if you have had ankle joint infections in the past. Risks Risks of any surgery and anesthesia are: Allergic reactions to medicines Breathing problems Bleeding Blood clot Infection Risks of ankle replacement surgery are: Ankle weakness, stiffness, or instability Loosening of the artificial joint over time Skin not healing after surgery Nerve damage Blood vessel damage Bone break during surgery Dislocation of the artificial joint Allergic reaction to the artificial joint (extremely uncommon) Before the Procedure Always tell your health care provider what medicines you are taking, even medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription. During the 2 weeks before your surgery: You may be asked to stop taking medicines that make it harder for your blood to clot. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve), blood thinners (such as Warfarin or Clopidogrel) and other medicines. Ask which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery. If you have diabetes , heart disease , or other medical conditions, your surgeon will ask you to see your provider who treats you for these conditions. Tell your provider if you have been drinking a lot of alcohol, more than 1 drink per day for women or 2 drinks per day for men. If you smoke, you should stop. Ask your provider for help. Smoking can slow down wound and bone healing. It will significantly increase your complications after surgery. Always let your provider know about any cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness you may have before your surgery. You may want to visit the physical therapist to learn some exercises to do before surgery. The physical therapist can also teach you how to correctly use crutches and a walker. On the day of your surgery: You will most often be asked not to drink or eat anything for 6 to 12 hours before the procedure. Take the medicines you were told to take with a small sip of water. Your provider will tell you when to arrive at the hospital. After the Procedure After surgery , you will most likely need to stay in the hospital for at least one night. You may have received a nerve block that controls pain for the first 12 to 24 hours after surgery. Your ankle will be in a cast or a splint after surgery. A small tube that helps drain blood from the ankle joint may be left in your ankle for 1 or 2 days. During your early recovery period, you should focus on keeping the swelling down by having your foot raised higher than your heart while you are sleeping or resting. You will see a physical therapist, who will teach you exercises that will help you move more easily. You most likely will not be able to put any weight on the ankle for a few months. Outlook (Prognosis) A successful ankle replacement will likely: Decrease or get rid of your pain Allow you to move your ankle up and down In most cases, total ankle replacements last 10 or more years. How long yours lasts will depend on your activity level, overall health, and the amount of damage to your ankle joint before surgery.

Aging changes in the skin are a group of common conditions and developments that occur as people grow older. Information Skin changes are among the most visible signs of aging. Evidence of increasing age includes wrinkles and sagging skin. Whitening or graying of the hair is another obvious sign of aging. Your skin does many things. It: Contains nerve receptors that allow you to feel touch, pain, and pressure Helps control fluid and electrolyte balance Helps control your body temperature Protects you from the environment Although skin has many layers, it can generally be divided into three main parts: The outer part (epidermis) contains skin cells, pigment, and proteins. The middle part (dermis) contains skin cells, blood vessels, nerves, hair follicles, and oil glands. The dermis provides nutrients to the epidermis. The inner layer under the dermis (the subcutaneous layer) contains sweat glands, some hair follicles, blood vessels, and fat. Each layer also contains connective tissue with collagen fibers to give support and elastin fibers to provide flexibility and strength. Watch this video about: Components of skin Skin changes are related to environmental factors, genetic makeup, nutrition, and other factors. The greatest single factor, though, is sun exposure. You can see this by comparing areas of your body that have regular sun exposure with areas that are protected from sunlight. Natural pigments seem to provide some protection against sun-induced skin damage. Blue-eyed, fair-skinned people show more aging skin changes than people with darker, more heavily pigmented skin. AGING CHANGES With aging, the outer skin layer (epidermis) thins, even though the number of cell layers remains unchanged. The number of pigment-containing cells (melanocytes) decreases. The remaining melanocytes increase in size. Aging skin looks thinner, paler, and clear (translucent). Pigmented spots including age spots or "liver spots" may appear in sun-exposed areas. The medical term for these areas is lentigos. Changes in the connective tissue reduce the skin's strength and elasticity. This is known as elastosis. It is more noticeable in sun-exposed areas (solar elastosis). Elastosis produces the leathery, weather-beaten appearance common to farmers, sailors, and others who spend a large amount of time outdoors. The blood vessels of the dermis become more fragile. This leads to bruising, bleeding under the skin (often called senile purpura), and cherry angiomas . Sebaceous glands produce less oil as you age. Men experience a minimal decrease, most often after the age of 80. Women gradually produce less oil beginning after menopause. This can make it harder to keep the skin moist, resulting in dryness and itchiness. The subcutaneous fat layer thins so it has less insulation and padding. This increases your risk of skin injury and reduces your ability to maintain body temperature. Because you have less natural insulation, you can get hypothermia in cold weather. Some medicines are absorbed by the fat layer. Shrinkage of this layer may change the way that these medicines work. The sweat glands produce less sweat. This makes it harder to keep cool. Your risk for overheating or developing heat stroke increases. Growths such as skin tags , warts , brown rough patches (seborrheic keratoses), and other blemishes are more common in older people. Also common are pinkish rough patches (actinic keratosis) which have a small chance of becoming a skin cancer. Skin cancers are also common and usually located in sun-exposed areas. EFFECT OF CHANGES As you age, you are at increased risk for skin injury. Your skin is thinner, more fragile, and you lose some of the protective fat layer. You also may be less able to sense touch, pressure, vibration, heat, and cold. Rubbing or pulling on the skin can cause skin tears. Fragile blood vessels can break easily. Bruises, flat collections of blood (purpura), and raised collections of blood ( hematomas ) may form after even a minor injury. Pressure ulcers can be caused by skin changes, loss of the fat layer, reduced activity, poor nutrition, and illnesses. Sores are most easily seen on the outside surface of the forearms, but they can occur anywhere on the body. Aging skin repairs itself more slowly than younger skin. Wound healing may be up to 4 times slower. This contributes to pressure ulcers and infections. Diabetes , blood vessel changes, lowered immunity, and other factors also affect healing. COMMON PROBLEMS Skin disorders are so common among older people that it is often hard to tell normal changes from those related to a disorder. More than 90% of all older people have some type of skin disorder. Skin disorders can be caused by many conditions, including: Blood vessel diseases, such as atherosclerosis Diabetes Heart disease Liver disease Nutritional deficiencies Obesity Reactions to medicines Stress Other causes of skin changes: Allergies to plants and other substances Climate Clothing Exposures to industrial and household chemicals Indoor heating Sunlight can cause: Loss of elasticity (elastosis) Noncancerous skin growths (keratoacanthomas) Pigment changes such as liver spots Thickening of the skin Sun exposure has also been directly linked to skin cancers, including basal cell cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. PREVENTION Because most skin changes are related to sun exposure, prevention is a lifelong process. Prevent sunburn if at all possible. Use a good quality sunscreen when outdoors, even in the winter. Wear protective clothing and a hat when needed. Good nutrition and adequate fluids are also helpful. Dehydration increases the risk of skin injury. Sometimes minor nutritional deficiencies can cause rashes, skin lesions , and other skin changes, even if you have no other symptoms. Keep skin moist with lotions and other moisturizers. . Do not use soaps that are strongly detergent (drying) or heavily perfumed. Bath oils are not recommended because they can cause you to slip and fall. Moist skin is more comfortable and will heal more quickly.

A medication abortion is the use of medicine to end an undesired pregnancy. The medicine helps remove the fetus and placenta from the woman's womb (uterus). Medication abortion is also called the abortion pill. A medication abortion is not the same as a miscarriage . Miscarriage is when a pregnancy ends on its own before the 20th week of pregnancy. Miscarriage is sometimes called a spontaneous abortion. An abortion procedure uses a medical procedure to end a pregnancy. Description A medication abortion can be done within 11 weeks of the first day of the woman's last period. A combination of two prescription hormone medicines is most often used to help the body expel the fetus and placenta tissue. Your health care provider may prescribe the medicines for you after doing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history. Medicines used are mifepristone and misoprostol. Your provider will prescribe the medicines, and you will take them at home. Some providers may require you to take the mifepristone in their office before you leave. After you take the medicine, your body will expel the pregnancy tissue. Most women have moderate to heavy bleeding and cramping for several hours. You may have nausea, diarrhea, and sometimes vomiting from taking misoprostol. Your provider may prescribe medicine for pain and nausea to ease your discomfort during this process. Why the Procedure is Performed Reasons a medication abortion might be considered include: You have made a personal decision to not carry the pregnancy. Your baby has a severe birth defect or genetic problem. Your pregnancy may be harmful to your health. The pregnancy resulted after a traumatic event such as rape or incest . The decision to end a pregnancy is very personal. To help weigh your choices, you may want to discuss your feelings with a counselor, provider, or a family member or friend. Risks Medication abortion is very safe and has been used in the United States for more than 20 years. Rare risks of medication abortion include: The medication abortion does not work and the pregnancy does not end Continued vaginal bleeding Pregnancy tissue not passing completely from body Blood clots in the uterus Infection Allergic reaction to one of the abortion medicines Before the Procedure Before the procedure, you may have the following tests: Pelvic exam to confirm the pregnancy and estimate how many weeks pregnant you are. A urine or blood HCG test to confirm that you are pregnant. A blood test checks your blood type. Based on the test result, you may need a special shot to prevent problems if you get pregnant in the future. The shot is called Rho(D) immune globulin (RhoGAM and other brands). An ultrasound test to check how many weeks pregnant you are and the location of the fetus in the uterus. After the Procedure It is very important to follow-up with your provider. This is to make sure the process was completed and all the tissue was expelled. The medicine may not work in a very small number of women. If this happens, another dose of the medicine or an abortion procedure may need to be done. Physical recovery most often occurs within a few days. It will depend on the stage of the pregnancy. Expect some vaginal bleeding and mild cramping for a few days. To relieve discomfort or pain in your abdomen: Apply a heating pad set on low or a hot water bottle filled with warm water on your abdomen to help ease discomfort. Take over-the-counter painkillers as instructed. Follow these activity guidelines after your procedure: Rest as needed. Do not do any vigorous activity for a few days. Light housework is fine. Avoid sexual intercourse for 2 to 3 weeks. A normal menstrual period should occur in about 4 to 6 weeks. You can get pregnant before your next period. Be sure to make arrangements to prevent pregnancy, particularly during the first month after the abortion. Outlook (Prognosis) Medication abortions are safe and effective. They rarely have serious complications. Alternative Names Medical abortion; Induced abortion; Nonsurgical abortion References American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists website.

Anorexia is an eating disorder that causes people to weigh less than is considered healthy for their age and height, usually by excessive weight loss. People with this disorder may have an intense fear of weight gain, even when they are underweight. They may diet or exercise too much or use other ways to lose weight. Causes The exact causes of anorexia are not known. Many factors may be involved. Genes and hormones may play a role. Social attitudes that promote very thin body types may also be involved. Risk factors for anorexia include: Being more worried about, or paying more attention to, weight and body shape Having an anxiety disorder as a child Having a negative self-image Having eating problems during infancy or early childhood Having certain social or cultural ideas about health and beauty Trying to be perfect or overly focused on rules Anorexia often begins during the pre-teen or teen years or young adulthood. It is more common in females, but may also be seen in males. Symptoms A person with anorexia usually: Has an intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even when underweight. Refuses to keep their weight at what is considered normal for their age and height (15% or more below the normal weight). Has a body image that is very distorted, is very focused on body weight or shape, and refuse to admit the danger of weight loss. People with anorexia may severely limit the amount of food they eat. Or they eat and then make themselves throw up. Other behaviors include: Cutting food into small pieces or moving them around the plate instead of eating Exercising all the time, even when the weather is bad, they are hurt, or their schedule is busy Going to the bathroom right after meals Refusing to eat around other people Using pills to make themselves urinate (water pills, or diuretics), have a bowel movement (enemas and laxatives), or decrease their appetite (diet pills) Other symptoms of anorexia may include: Blotchy or yellow skin that is dry and covered with fine hair Confused or slow thinking, along with poor memory or judgment Depression Dry mouth Extreme sensitivity to cold (wearing several layers of clothing to stay warm) Thinning of the bones ( osteoporosis ) Wasting away of muscle and loss of body fat Exams and Tests Tests should be done to help find the cause of weight loss, or see what damage the weight loss has caused. Many of these tests will be repeated over time to monitor the person. These tests may include: Albumin (serum) Bone density test to check for thin bones (osteoporosis) Complete blood count (CBC) Electrocardiogram (ECG) Electrolytes Kidney function tests Liver function tests Total protein (serum) Thyroid function tests Urinalysis Treatment The biggest challenge in treating anorexia nervosa is helping the person recognize that they have an illness. Most people with anorexia deny that they have an eating disorder. They often seek treatment only when their condition is serious. Goals of treatment are to restore normal body weight and eating habits. A weight gain of 1 to 3 pounds (lb) or 0.5 to 1.5 kilograms (kg) per week is considered a safe goal. Different programs have been designed to treat anorexia. These may include any of the following measures: Increasing social activity Reducing the amount of physical activity Using schedules for eating To start, a short hospital stay may be recommended. This is followed by a day treatment program. A longer hospital stay may be needed if: The person has lost a lot of weight (being below 70% of their ideal body weight for their age and height). For severe and life-threatening malnutrition , the person may need to be fed through a vein or stomach tube. Weight loss continues, even with treatment. Medical complications, such as heart problems, confusion, or low potassium levels develop. The person has severe depression or thinks about committing suicide. Care providers who are usually involved in these programs include: Nurse practitioners Physicians Physician assistants Dietitians Mental health care providers Treatment is often very difficult. People and their families must work hard. Many therapies may be tried until the disorder is under control. People may drop out of programs if they have unrealistic hopes of being cured with therapy alone. Different kinds of talk therapy are used to treat people with anorexia: Cognitive behavioral therapy (a type of talk therapy), group therapy, and family therapy have all been successful. Goal of therapy is to change a person's thoughts or behavior to encourage them to eat in a healthier way. This kind of therapy is more useful for treating younger people who have not had anorexia for a long time. If the person is young, therapy may involve the whole family. The family is seen as a part of the solution, instead of the cause of the eating disorder. Support groups may also be a part of treatment. In support groups, people with anorexia and their families meet and share what they have been through. Medicines such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers may help some people when given as part of a complete treatment program. These medicines can help treat depression or anxiety. Although medicines may help, none has been proven to decrease the desire to lose weight. Support Groups The stress of illness can be eased by joining a support group . Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. Outlook (Prognosis) Anorexia is a serious condition that can be life threatening. Treatment programs can help people with the condition return to a normal weight. But it is common for the disease to relapse. Women who develop this eating disorder at an early age have a better chance of recovering completely. Most people with anorexia will continue to prefer a lower body weight and be very focused on food and calories. Weight management may be hard. Long-term treatment may be needed to stay at a healthy weight. Possible Complications Anorexia can be dangerous. It may lead to serious health problems over time, including: Bone weakening Decrease in white blood cells, which leads to increased risk of infection A low potassium level in the blood, which may cause dangerous heart rhythms Severe lack of water and fluids in the body ( dehydration ) Lack of protein, vitamins, minerals, and other important nutrients in the body ( malnutrition ) Seizures due to fluid or sodium loss from repeated diarrhea or vomiting Thyroid gland problems Tooth decay Suicidal thinking or behavior When to Contact a Medical Professional Talk to your health care provider if someone you care about is: Too focused on weight Over-exercising Limiting the food he or she eats Very underweight Showing suicidal thinking or behavior Getting medical help right away can make an eating disorder less severe. If you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org . You can also call 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides free and confidential support 24/7, anytime day or night. You can also call 911 or the local emergency number or go to the hospital emergency room. DO NOT delay. If someone you know has attempted suicide, call 911 or the local emergency number right away. DO NOT leave the person alone, even after you have called for help.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is cancer that starts inside bone marrow. This is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells. The cancer grows from cells that would normally turn into white blood cells. Acute means the disease grows quickly and usually has an aggressive course. Causes AML is one of the most common types of leukemia among adults. AML is more common in men than women. The bone marrow helps the body fight infections and makes other blood components. People with AML have many abnormal immature white blood cells inside their bone marrow. The cells grow very quickly, and replace healthy blood cells. As a result, people with AML are more likely to have infections. They also have an increased risk of bleeding as the numbers of healthy blood cells decrease. Most of the time, a health care provider cannot tell you what caused AML. However, the following things can lead to some types of leukemia, including AML: Blood disorders, including polycythemia vera , essential thrombocythemia , and myelodysplasia Certain chemicals (for example, benzene) Certain chemotherapy drugs, including etoposide and drugs known as alkylating agents Exposure to certain chemicals and harmful substances Radiation Weak immune system due to an organ transplant Problems with your genes may also cause development of AML. Symptoms AML does not have any specific symptoms. Symptoms seen are mainly due to the related conditions. Symptoms of AML may include any of the following: Bleeding from the nose Bleeding and swelling (rare) in the gums Bruising Bone pain or tenderness Fever and fatigue Heavy menstrual periods Pale skin Shortness of breath (gets worse with exercise) Weight loss Exams and Tests The provider will perform a physical exam. There may be signs of a swollen spleen, liver, or lymph nodes. Tests done include: A complete blood count ( CBC ) may show anemia and a low number of platelets. A white blood cell count ( WBC ) can be high, low, or normal. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy will show if there are any leukemia cells. If your provider learns you do have this type of leukemia, further tests will be done to determine the specific type of AML. Subtypes are based on specific changes in genes (mutations) and how the leukemia cells appear under the microscope. Treatment Treatment involves using medicines ( chemotherapy ) to kill the cancer cells. Most types of AML are treated with more than one chemotherapy medicine. Drugs that are targeted to specific mutations in the leukemic cells are also often used. Chemotherapy kills normal cells, too. This may cause side effects such as: Increased risk of bleeding Increased risk for infection (your doctor may want you to keep away from other people to prevent infection) Weight loss ( you will need to eat extra calories ) Mouth sores Other supportive treatments for AML may include: Antibiotics to treat infection Red blood cell transfusions to fight anemia Platelet transfusions to control bleeding A bone marrow (stem cell) transplant may be tried. This decision is decided by several factors, including: Your age and overall health Certain genetic changes in the leukemia cells The availability of donors Support Groups You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group . Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. Outlook (Prognosis) When a bone marrow biopsy shows no evidence of AML, you are said to be in remission. How well you do depends on your overall health and the genetic subtype of the AML cells. Remission is not the same as a cure. More therapy is usually needed, either in the form of more chemotherapy or a bone marrow transplant. With treatment, younger people with AML tend to do better than those who develop the disease at an older age. The 5-year survival rate is much lower in older adults than in younger people. Experts say this is partly due to the fact that younger people are better able to tolerate strong chemotherapy medicines. Also, leukemia in older people tends to be more resistant to current treatments. If the cancer does not come back (relapse) within 5 years of the diagnosis, you are likely cured. When to Contact a Medical Professional Call for an appointment with your provider if you: Develop symptoms of AML Have AML and have a fever that will not go away or other signs of infection Prevention If you work around radiation or chemicals linked to leukemia, always wear protective gear.

Angioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. These blood vessels are called the coronary arteries. A coronary artery stent is a small, metal mesh tube that expands inside a coronary artery. A stent is often placed during or immediately after angioplasty. It helps prevent the artery from closing up again. A drug-eluting stent has medicine embedded in it that helps prevent the artery from closing in the long term. Watch this video about: Balloon angioplasty - short segment Description Before the angioplasty procedure begins, you will receive some pain medicine. You may also be given medicine that relaxes you, and blood-thinning medicines to prevent a blood clot from forming. You will lie on a padded table. Your doctor will insert a flexible tube (catheter) into an artery. Sometimes the catheter will be placed in your arm or wrist, or in your upper leg (groin) area. You will be awake during the procedure. The doctor will use live x-ray pictures to carefully guide the catheter up into your heart and arteries. Liquid contrast (sometimes called "dye," will be injected into your body to highlight blood flow through the arteries. This helps the doctor see any blockages in the blood vessels that lead to your heart. A guide wire is moved into and across the blockage. A balloon catheter is pushed over the guide wire and into the blockage. The balloon on the end is blown up (inflated). This opens the blocked vessel and restores proper blood flow to the heart. A wire mesh tube (stent) may then be placed in this blocked area. The stent is inserted along with the balloon catheter. It expands when the balloon is inflated. The stent is left there to help keep the artery open. The stent is almost always coated with a drug (called a drug-eluting stent). This type of stent may lower the chance of the artery closing back up in the future. Why the Procedure is Performed Arteries can become narrowed or blocked by deposits called plaque. Plaque is made up of fat and cholesterol that builds up on the inside of artery walls. This condition is called hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis). Angioplasty may be used to treat: Blockage in a coronary artery during or after a heart attack Blockage or narrowing of one or more coronary arteries that may lead to poor heart function (heart failure) Narrowings that reduce blood flow and cause persistent chest pain ( angina ) that medicines do not control Not every blockage can or need to be treated with angioplasty. Some people who have several blockages or blockages in certain locations may need coronary bypass surgery . Some blockages are treated with medical therapy rather than an interventional procedure. Risks Angioplasty is generally safe, but ask your doctor about the possible complications. Risks of angioplasty and stent placement are: Allergic reaction to the drug used in a drug-eluting stent, the stent material (very rare), or the x-ray dye Bleeding or clotting in the area where the catheter was inserted Blood clot Clogging of the inside of the stent (in-stent restenosis). This can be life threatening. Damage to a heart valve or blood vessel Heart attack Kidney failure (higher risk in people who already have kidney problems) Irregular heartbeat ( arrhythmias ) Stroke (this is rare) Before the Procedure Angioplasty is often performed when you go to the hospital or emergency room for chest pain, or after a heart attack. If you are admitted to the hospital for angioplasty: Tell your health care provider what drugs you are taking, even drugs or herbs you bought without a prescription. You will most often be asked not to drink or eat anything for 6 to 8 hours before the test. Take the drugs your provider told you to take with a small sip of water. Tell your provider if you are allergic to seafood, you have had a bad reaction to contrast material or iodine in the past, you are taking Viagra, or you are or might be pregnant. After the Procedure The average hospital stay is 2 days or less. Some people may not even have to stay overnight in the hospital. In general, people who have angioplasty are able to walk around within a few hours after the procedure depending on how the procedure went and where the catheter was placed. Complete recovery takes a week or less. You will be given information how to care for yourself after angioplasty . Outlook (Prognosis) For most people, angioplasty greatly improves blood flow through the coronary artery and the heart. It may help you avoid the need for coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Angioplasty does not cure the cause of the blockage in your arteries. Your arteries may become narrow again. Follow your heart-healthy diet, exercise, stop smoking (if you smoke), and reduce stress to lower your chances of having another blocked artery.Your provider may prescribe medicine to help lower your cholesterol or control your blood pressure. Taking these steps can help reduce your chances of complications from atherosclerosis.

Achilles tendinitis occurs when the tendon that connects the back of your leg to your heel becomes swollen and painful near the bottom of the foot. This tendon is called the Achilles tendon. It allows you to push your foot down. You use your Achilles tendon when walking, running, and jumping. Causes There are two large muscles in the calf. These create the power needed to push off with the foot or go up on the toes. The large Achilles tendon connects these muscles to the heel. Heel pain is most often due to overuse of the foot. Rarely, it is caused by an injury. Tendinitis due to overuse is most common in younger people. It can occur in walkers, runners, or other athletes. Achilles tendinitis may be more likely to occur if: There is a sudden increase in the amount or intensity of an activity. Your calf muscles are very tight (not stretched out). You run on hard surfaces, such as concrete. You run too often. You jump a lot (such as when playing basketball). You do not wear shoes that give your feet proper support. Your foot suddenly turns in or out. Tendinitis from arthritis is more common in middle-aged and older adults. A bone spur or growth may form in the back of the heel bone. This may irritate the Achilles tendon and cause pain and swelling. Flat feet will put more tension on the tendon. Symptoms Symptoms include pain in the heel and along the length of the tendon when walking or running. The area may feel painful and stiff in the morning. The tendon may be painful to touch or move. The area may be swollen and warm. You may have trouble standing up on your toes. You may also have trouble finding shoes that fit comfortably due to pain in the back of your heel. Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform a physical exam. They will look for tenderness along the tendon and pain in the area of the tendon when you stand on your toes. X-rays can help diagnose bone problems. An MRI scan of the foot may be done if you are considering surgery or there is a chance that you have a tear in the Achilles tendon. Treatment The main treatments for Achilles tendinitis do not involve surgery. It is important to remember that it may take at least 2 to 3 months for the pain to go away. Try putting ice on the Achilles tendon area for 15 to 20 minutes, 2 to 3 times per day. Remove the ice if the area gets numb. Changes in activity may help manage the symptoms: Decrease or stop any activity that causes pain. Run or walk on smoother and softer surfaces. Switch to biking, swimming, or other activities that put less stress on the Achilles tendon. Your provider or physical therapist can show you stretching exercises or eccentric loading exercises for the Achilles tendon. You may also need to make changes in your footwear, such as: Using a brace, boot or cast to keep the heel and tendon still and allow the swelling to go down Placing heel lifts in the shoe under the heel Wearing shoes that are softer in the areas over and under the heel cushion Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and ibuprofen, can help ease pain or swelling. Other treatment include injections, such as platelet rich plasma or steroids, to reduce the inflammation. However, the tendon can become even weaker following injection and should be protected after the injections. If these treatments do not improve symptoms, you may need surgery to remove inflamed tissue and abnormal areas of the tendon. If there is a bone spur irritating the tendon, surgery can be used to remove the spur. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) may be an alternative to surgery for people who have not responded to other treatments. This treatment uses low-dose sound waves. Outlook (Prognosis) In most cases, lifestyle changes help improve symptoms. Keep in mind that symptoms may return if you do not limit activities that cause pain, or if you do not maintain the strength and flexibility of the tendon. Possible Complications Achilles tendinitis may make you more likely to have an Achilles rupture. This condition most often causes a sharp pain that feels as if you have been hit in the back of the heel with a stick. Surgical repair is often necessary. However, the surgery may not be as successful as usual because there is already damage to the tendon. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if: You have pain in the heel around the Achilles tendon that is worse with activity. You have sharp pain and are unable to walk or push-off without extreme pain or weakness. Prevention Exercises to keep your calf muscles strong and flexible will help reduce the risk for tendinitis. Overusing a weak or tight Achilles tendon makes you more likely to develop tendinitis.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a problem caused by the presence of one or more of these findings: Not being able to focus Being overactive Not being able to control behavior Causes ADHD often begins in childhood. But it may continue into the adult years. ADHD is diagnosed more often in boys than in girls. It is not clear what causes ADHD. It may be linked to genes and home or social factors. Experts have found that the brains of children with ADHD are different from those of children without ADHD. Brain chemicals are also different. Symptoms ADHD symptoms fall into three groups: Not being able to focus (inattentiveness) Being extremely active ( hyperactivity ) Not being able to control behavior (impulsivity) Some people with ADHD have mainly inattentive symptoms. Some have mainly hyperactive and impulsive symptoms. Others have a combination of these behaviors. INATTENTIVE SYMPTOMS Doesn't pay attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork Has problems focusing during tasks or play Doesn't listen when spoken to directly Doesn't follow through on instructions and doesn't finish schoolwork or chores Has problems organizing tasks and activities Avoids or doesn't like tasks that require mental effort (such as schoolwork) Often loses things, such as homework or toys Is easily distracted Is often forgetful Has trouble concentrating HYPERACTIVITY SYMPTOMS Fidgets or squirms in seat Leaves their seat when they should stay in their seat Runs about or climbs when they shouldn't be doing so Has problems playing or working quietly Is often on the go, acts as if "driven by a motor" Talks all the time IMPULSIVITY SYMPTOMS Blurts out answers before questions have been completed Has problems awaiting their turn Interrupts or intrudes on others (butts into conversations or games) Many of the above findings are present in children as they grow. For these problems to be diagnosed as ADHD, they must be out of the normal range for a person's age and development. Exams and Tests There is no test that can diagnose ADHD. Diagnosis is based on a pattern of the symptoms listed above. When a child is suspected to have ADHD, parents and teachers are often involved during the evaluation. Most children with ADHD have at least one other developmental or mental health issue. This may be a mood, anxiety, or substance use disorder. Or, it may be a learning issue or a tic disorder. Treatment Treating ADHD is a partnership between your health care provider and the person with ADHD. If it's a child, parents and often teachers are involved. For treatment to work, it is important to: Set specific goals that are right for you or your child. Start medicine or talk therapy, or both. Follow-up regularly with your provider to check on goals, results, and any side effects of medicines. If treatment does not seem to work, your provider will likely: Confirm the person has ADHD. Check for health problems that can cause similar symptoms. Make sure the treatment plan is being followed. MEDICINES Medicine combined with behavioral treatment often works best. Different ADHD medicines can be used alone or combined with each other. Your provider will decide which medicine is right, based on your child's symptoms and needs. Psychostimulants (also known as stimulants) are the most commonly used medicines. Although these medicines are called stimulants, they actually have a calming effect on people with ADHD. Other medicines that are not stimulants are FDA approved for some people with ADHD. Ask your provider what is best for you. Follow your provider's instructions about how to take ADHD medicine. Your provider needs to monitor if the medicine is working and if there are any problems with it. So, be sure to keep all appointments with your provider. Some ADHD medicines have side effects. If you or your child has side effects, contact your provider right away. The dosage or medicine itself may need to be changed. THERAPY A common type of ADHD therapy is called behavioral therapy. It teaches children and parents healthy behaviors and how to manage disruptive behaviors. For mild ADHD, behavioral therapy alone (without medicine) may be effective. Other tips to help a child with ADHD include: Talk regularly with your child's teacher. Keep a daily schedule, including regular times for homework, meals, and activities. Make changes to the schedule ahead of time and not at the last moment. Limit distractions in your child's environment. Make sure your child gets a healthy, varied diet, with plenty of fiber and basic nutrients. Make sure your child gets enough sleep. Praise and reward good behavior. Provide clear and consistent rules for your child. There is little proof that alternative treatments for ADHD such as herbs, supplements, and chiropractic treatments are helpful. Support Groups You can find help and support in dealing with ADHD at: Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD) -- chadd.org Outlook (Prognosis) ADHD is a long-term condition. ADHD may lead to: Illegal drug use and alcohol misuse Not doing well in school Problems keeping a job Trouble with the law One third to one half of children with ADHD have symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity as adults. Adults with ADHD are often able to control behavior and mask problems. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you or your child's teachers suspect ADHD.

Abdominal wall surgery is a procedure that improves the appearance of flabby, stretched-out abdominal (belly) muscles and skin. It is also called a tummy tuck. It can range from a simple mini-tummy tuck to more extensive surgery. Abdominal wall surgery is not the same as liposuction , which is another way to remove fat. But, abdominal wall surgery is sometimes combined with liposuction. Description Your surgery will be done in an operating room in a hospital. You will receive general anesthesia . This will keep you asleep and pain-free during the procedure. The surgery takes 2 to 6 hours. You can expect to stay in the hospital for 1 to 3 days after surgery. After you receive anesthesia, your surgeon will make a cut (incision) across your abdomen to open up the area. This cut will be just above your pubic area. Your surgeon will remove fatty tissue and loose skin from the middle and lower sections of your abdomen to make it firmer and flatter. In extended surgeries, the surgeon also removes excess fat and skin (love handles) from the sides of the abdomen. Your abdominal muscles may be tightened also. Mini abdominoplasty is performed when there are areas of fat pockets (love handles). It can be done with much smaller cuts. Your surgeon will close your cut with stitches. Small tubes called drains may be inserted to allow fluid to drain out of your cut. These will be removed later. A firm elastic dressing (bandage) will be placed over your abdomen. For less complicated surgery, your surgeon may use a medical device called an endoscope. Endoscopes are small cameras that are inserted into the skin through very small cuts. They are connected to a video monitor in the operating room that allows the surgeon to see the area being worked on. Your surgeon will remove excess fat with other small tools that are inserted through other small cuts. This surgery is called endoscopic surgery. Why the Procedure is Performed Most of the time, this surgery is an elective or cosmetic procedure because it is an operation you choose to have. It is not usually needed for health reasons. Cosmetic abdomen repair can help improve appearance, particularly after a lot of weight gain or loss. It helps flatten the lower abdomen and tighten stretched skin. It may also help relieve skin rashes or infections that develop under large flaps of skin. Abdominoplasty can be helpful when: Diet and exercise have not helped improve muscle tone, such as in women who have had more than one pregnancy. Skin and muscle cannot regain its normal tone. This can be a problem for very overweight people who lost a lot of weight. This procedure is a major surgery. Be sure you understand the risks and benefits before having it. Abdominoplasty is not used as an alternative to weight loss. Risks Risks for anesthesia and surgery in general are: Reactions to medicines Breathing problems Bleeding , blood clots, or infection Risks for this surgery are: Excessive scarring Loss of skin Nerve damage that can cause pain or numbness in part of your belly Poor healing Before the Procedure Tell your surgeon or nurse: If you could be pregnant What medicines you are taking, even medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription Before surgery: Several days before surgery, you may be asked to temporarily stop taking blood thinners. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin), and others. Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery. If you smoke, try to stop. Smoking increases the risk for problems such as slow healing. Ask your health care provider for help quitting. On the day of surgery: Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking. Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water. Arrive at the hospital on time. After the Procedure You will have some pain and discomfort for several days after surgery. Your surgeon will prescribe pain medicine to help you manage your pain. It may help to rest with your legs and hips bent during recovery to reduce pressure on your abdomen. Wearing an elastic support similar to a girdle for 2 to 3 weeks will provide extra support while you heal. You should avoid strenuous activity and anything that makes you strain for 4 to 6 weeks. You will probably be able to return to work in 2 to 4 weeks. Your scars will become flatter and lighter in color over the next year. DO NOT expose the area to sun, because it can worsen the scar and darken the color. Keep it covered when you are out in the sun. Outlook (Prognosis) Most people are happy with the results of abdominoplasty. Many feel a new sense of self-confidence.

Platelets are small cells in your blood that your body uses to form clots and stop bleeding. If you have too many platelets or your platelets stick together too much, you are more likely to form clots. This clotting can take place on the inside of your arteries and lead to heart attack or stroke . Antiplatelet drugs work to make your platelets less sticky and thereby help prevent blood clots from forming in your arteries. Aspirin is an antiplatelet drug that may be used. P2Y12 receptor blockers are another group of antiplatelet drugs. This group of drugs includes: clopidogrel, ticlopidine, ticagrelor, prasugrel, and cangrelor. Who Should Take Antiplatelet Drugs Antiplatelet drugs may be used to: Prevent heart attack or stroke for those with peripheral arterial disease (most often blockage of an artery in the leg). Clopidogrel (Plavix, generic) may be used in place of aspirin for people who have narrowing of the coronary arteries or who have had a stent inserted. Sometimes 2 antiplatelet drugs (one of which is almost always aspirin) are prescribed for people with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or heart attack), or those who have received a coronary stent during PCI. Aspirin and a second antiplatelet drug are usually recommended for people who are undergoing angioplasty with or without stenting. Prevent or treat heart attacks. Prevent stroke or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs are early warning signs of stroke. They are also called "mini-strokes.") Prevent clots from forming inside stents put inside your arteries to open them. Acute coronary syndrome. After bypass graft surgery that uses a man-made or prosthetic graft performed on arteries below the knee. Your health care provider will choose which one of these drugs are best for your problem. At times, you may be asked to take low dose aspirin along with one of these drugs. Side Effects Side effects of this medicine may include: Diarrhea Itching Nausea Skin rash Stomach pain Before you start taking these medicines, tell your provider if: You have bleeding problems or stomach ulcers . You are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. There are a number of other possible side effects, depending on which drug you are prescribed. For example: Ticlopidine may lead to a very low white blood cell count or an immune disorder that destroys platelets. Ticagrelor may cause episodes of shortness of breath. Taking P2Y12 Inhibitors This medicine is taken as a pill. Your provider may change your dose from time to time. Take this medicine with food and plenty of water to reduce side effects. You may need to stop taking clopidogrel before you have surgery or dental work. Do not just stop taking your medicine without first talking with your provider. Talk with your provider before taking any of these drugs: Heparin and other blood thinners, such as warfarin (Coumadin) Pain or arthritis medicine that are NSAIDs (such as diclofenac, etodolac, ibuprofen, indomethacin, Advil, Aleve, Daypro, Dolobid, Feldene, Indocin, Motrin, Orudis, Relafen, or Voltaren) Phenytoin (Dilantin), tamoxifen (Nolvadex, Soltamox), tolbutamide (Orinase), or torsemide (Demadex) Do not take other drugs that may have aspirin or ibuprofen in them before talking with your provider. Read the labels on cold and flu medicines. Ask what other medicines are safe for you to take for aches and pains, colds, or the flu. If you have any type of procedure scheduled, you may need to stop these drugs 5 to 7 days before hand. However, always check with your provider first about whether it is safe to stop. Tell your provider if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed. Women in the later stages of pregnancy should not take clopidogrel. Clopidogrel can be passed to infants through breast milk. Talk with your provider if you have liver or kidney disease. If you miss a dose: Take it as soon as possible, unless it is time for your next dose. If it is time for your next dose, take your usual amount. Do not take extra pills to make up for a dose you have missed, unless your doctor tells you to. Store these drugs and all other medicines in a cool, dry place. Keep them where children cannot get to them. When to Call the Doctor Contact your provider if you have any of these side effects and they do not go away: Any signs of unusual bleeding, such as blood in the urine or stools, nosebleeds, any unusual bruising, heavy bleeding from cuts, black tarry stools, coughing up blood, heavier than usual menstrual bleeding or unexpected vaginal bleeding, vomit that looks like coffee grounds Dizziness Difficulty swallowing Tightness in your chest or chest pain Swelling in your face or hands Itching, hives, or tingling in your face or hands Wheezing or difficulty breathing Very bad stomach pain Skin rash Alternative Names Blood thinners - clopidogrel; Antiplatelet therapy - clopidogrel; Thienopyridines Images Plaque buildup in arteries References Abraham NS, Hlatky MA, Antman EM, et al.

You had surgery to repair a damaged ligament in your knee called the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). This article tells you how to care for yourself when you go home from the hospital. When You're in the Hospital You had surgery to reconstruct your anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The surgeon drilled sockets and tunnels in the bones of your knee and attached the new ligament to the bone. You may also have had surgery to repair other tissue in your knee. What to Expect at Home You may need help taking care of yourself when you first go home. Plan for a spouse, friend, or neighbor to help you. It can take from a few days to a few months to be ready to return to work. How soon you return to work will depend on the kind of work you do. It often takes 4 to 6 months to return to your full level of activity and take part in sports again after surgery. Activity Your health care provider will ask you to rest when you first go home. You will be told to: Keep your leg propped up on 1 or 2 pillows. Place the pillows under your foot or calf muscle. This helps keep swelling down. Do this 4 to 6 times a day for the first week after surgery. Do not put the pillow behind your knee. Keep your knee straight. Be careful not to get the dressing on your knee wet. Do not use a heating pad. You may need to wear special support stockings to help prevent blood clots from forming. Your provider will also give you exercises to keep the blood moving in your foot, ankle, and leg. These exercises will also lower your risk for blood clots. You will need to use crutches when you go home. You may be able to begin putting your full weight on your repaired leg without crutches 2 to 3 weeks after surgery, if your surgeon says it is OK. If you had work on your knee in addition to ACL reconstruction, it may take 4 to 8 weeks to regain full use of your knee. Ask your surgeon how long you will need to be on crutches. You may also need to wear a special knee brace. The brace will be set so that your knee can move only a certain amount in any direction. Do not change the settings on the brace yourself. The brace is usually locked when you are using crutches when walking for the first few weeks. Ask your provider or physical therapist about sleeping without the brace and removing it for showers. When the brace is off for any reason, be careful not to move your knee more than you can when you have the brace on. You will need to learn how to go up and down stairs using crutches or with a knee brace on. Physical therapy most often begins about 1 to 2 weeks after surgery, however you can do some simple postoperative knee exercises immediately after surgery. The duration of physical therapy may be 2 to 6 months. You will need to limit your activity and movement while your knee mends. Your physical therapist will give you an exercise program to help you build strength in your knee and avoid injury. Staying active and building strength in the muscles of your legs will help speed your recovery. Getting full range of motion in your leg soon after surgery is also important. Wound Care You will go home with a dressing and an elastic bandage around your knee. Do not remove them until the provider says it is OK. Until then, keep the dressing and bandage clean and dry . You can shower again after your dressing is removed. When you shower, wrap your leg in plastic to keep it from getting wet until your stitches or tape strips (Steri-Strips) have been removed. Make sure that your provider says this is OK. After that, you may get the incisions wet when you shower. Be sure to dry the area well. If you need to change your dressing for any reason, put the elastic bandage back on over the new dressing. Wrap the elastic bandage loosely around your knee. Start from the calf and wrap it around your leg and knee. Do not wrap it too tightly. Keep wearing the elastic bandage until your provider tells you it is OK to remove it. Pain Pain is normal after knee arthroscopy. It should ease up over time. Your provider will give you a prescription for pain medicine before your surgery. Get it filled ahead of time so that you have it when you need it. Take your pain medicine when you start having pain so the pain doesn't get too bad. You may have received a nerve block during surgery, so that your nerves do not feel pain. It is normal that your leg will feel a bit numb after the nerve block. The numbness can last for hours and sometimes up to a day. Make sure you take your pain medicine, even when the block is working. The block will wear off, and pain can return very quickly. Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or another medicine like it may also help. Ask your provider what other medicines are safe to take with your pain medicine. Do not drive if you are taking narcotic pain medicine. This medicine may make you too sleepy to drive safely. When to Call the Doctor Contact your provider if: Blood is soaking through your dressing, and the bleeding does not stop when you put pressure on the area Pain does not go away after you take pain medicine You have swelling or pain in your calf muscle Your foot or toes look darker than normal or are cool to the touch You have redness, pain, swelling, or yellowish discharge from your incisions You have a temperature higher than 101°F (38.3°C) Alternative Names Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction - discharge References Brotzman SB.

Ambiguous genitalia is a rare condition where a child is born with outer genitals that do not clearly look either male or female. They may have features of both sexes or not be fully developed. The characteristics of the child's genitals may not match their internal sex organs or their genetic sex. This condition is also called uncertain genitalia or atypical genitalia. Ambiguous genitalia is common in children with differences of sex development (DSD). Considerations The genetic sex of a child is determined at conception. The mother's egg cell contains an X chromosome , while the father's sperm cell contains either an X or a Y chromosome. These X and Y chromosomes determine the child's genetic sex. Normally, an infant inherits 1 pair of sex chromosomes, 1 X from the mother and 1 X or 1 Y from the father. A baby who inherits the X chromosome from the father has 2 X chromosomes and is a genetic female. A baby who inherits the Y chromosome from the father has 1 X and 1 Y chromosome and is a genetic male. The male and female reproductive organs and genitals both come from the same tissue in the fetus. Ambiguous genitalia can develop if the process that causes this fetal tissue to become "male" or "female" is disrupted. This means the external genitals do look clearly male or female or may have characteristics of both. The physical appearance of people with this condition can vary widely. Very rarely, the physical appearance may be fully developed as the opposite of the genetic sex. For example, a genetic male may have developed the appearance of a female. In most cases, ambiguous genitalia in genetic females (infants with 2 X chromosomes) has the following features: An enlarged clitoris that looks like a small penis . The urethral opening (where urine comes out) can be anywhere along, above, or below the surface of the clitoris. The labia may be fused and look like a scrotum . The infant may be thought to be a male with undescended testicles . Sometimes a lump of tissue is felt within the fused labia, further making it look like a scrotum with testicles . In a genetic male (1 X and 1 Y chromosome), ambiguous genitalia most often include the following features: A small penis (less than 2 to 3 centimeters, or 3/4 to 1 1/4 inches) that looks like an enlarged clitoris (the clitoris of a newborn female is normally somewhat enlarged at birth). The urethral opening may be anywhere along, above, or below the penis ( hypospadias ). It can be located as low as the perineum, further making the infant appear to be female. There may be a small scrotum that is separated and looks like labia. Undescended testicles commonly occur with ambiguous genitalia. With a few exceptions, ambiguous genitalia is most often not life-threatening. However, its treatment has short- and long-term consequences. For this reason, a team of health care professionals with expertise in DSD will work together to understand and treat the child and support the family. This team may include neonatologists, geneticists, endocrinologists, and psychiatrists or social workers. The specific treatment will depend on the specific cause of the ambiguous genitalia. Causes Causes for ambiguous genitalia include: 46,XX disorder of sex development (DSD) and 46,XY DSD. The genitalia are of one sex, but some physical characteristics of the other sex are present. Ovotesticular DSD. This is a very rare condition, in which tissue from both the ovaries and testicles is present. The child may have parts of both male and female genitals. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia . This condition has several forms, but the most common form causes a genetic female to appear male. Infants are tested for this potentially life-threatening condition during newborn screening exams. Chromosomal abnormalities, including Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) and Turner syndrome (45,X). If the mother takes certain medicines (such as androgenic steroids), a genetic female may look more male. Lack of production of certain hormones can cause the embryo to develop with a female body type, regardless of genetic sex. Androgen insensitivity syndrome. Even if the body makes the hormones needed to develop into a physical male, the body does not respond normally to those hormones. This may produce female characteristics, even though the genetic sex is male. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your health care provider if you are concerned about the appearance of your child's external genitalia, or your baby: Takes more than 2 weeks to regain his or her birth weight Poor feeding or vomiting Looks dehydrated (dry inside of mouth, no tears when crying, less than 4 wet diapers per 24 hours, eyes look sunken in) Has a decreased appetite Has blue spells (may indicate short periods when a reduced amount of blood flows into the lungs) Has trouble breathing These can all be signs of congenital adrenal hyperplasia . Ambiguous genitalia may be discovered during the first well-baby exam . What to Expect at Your Office Visit The provider will perform a physical exam which may reveal genitals that are not "typical male" or "typical female," but somewhere in between. The provider will ask medical history questions to help identify any chromosomal disorders. Questions may include: Is there any family history of miscarriage ? Is there any family history of stillbirth ? Is there any family history of early death? Have any family members had infants who died in the first few weeks of life or who had ambiguous genitalia? Is there any family history of any of the disorders that cause ambiguous genitalia? What medicines did the mother take before or during pregnancy (especially steroids)? What other symptoms are present? The following tests may be done: Chromosome analysis (karyotyping) to determine the person's genetic makeup Blood tests to check levels of testosterone , luteinizing hormone (LH) , and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) Electrolyte tests Specific molecular testing Endoscopy , abdominal x-ray , abdominal or pelvic ultrasound, and similar tests may be needed to determine the presence or absence of the internal genitals (such as undescended testes). In some cases, laparoscopy , exploratory laparotomy , or biopsy of the gonads may be needed to confirm disorders that can cause ambiguous genitalia. Depending on the cause, surgery, hormone replacement, or other treatments are used to treat conditions that can cause ambiguous genitalia. There have been significant changes in treating ambiguous genitalia. In the past, it was thought that it was best to assign a gender as quickly as possible. This was often based on the external genitals rather than the chromosomal gender. Expert opinion has shifted to understanding that chromosomal, neural, hormonal, psychological, and behavioral factors can all influence gender identity. Many experts now urge delaying definitive surgery for as long as is healthy, and ideally involving the child in the decision, unless surgery is needed for the health of the infant. Working with your child’s heath care team can help you make the best choices for your child. In addition, a DSD support group can help provide families with the latest research and offer a community of other families, children, and adult individuals who have faced the same issues.

Addison disease is a disorder that causes the adrenal glands to not produce enough hormones. Causes The adrenal glands are small hormone-releasing organs located on top of each kidney. They are made up of an outer portion, called the cortex, and an inner portion, called the medulla. The cortex produces 3 hormones: Glucocorticoid hormones (such as cortisol) maintain sugar (glucose) control, blood pressure, decrease (suppress) immune response , and help the body respond to stress. Mineralocorticoid hormones (such as aldosterone) regulate sodium, water and potassium balance. Sex hormones, androgens (male) and estrogens (female), affect sexual development and sex drive. Addison disease results from damage to the adrenal cortex. The damage causes the cortex to produce hormone levels that are too low. This damage may be caused by the following: The immune system mistakenly attacking the adrenal glands ( autoimmune disease ) Infections such as tuberculosis , HIV , or fungal infections Hemorrhage into the adrenal glands Tumors Risk factors for the autoimmune type of Addison disease include other autoimmune diseases: Swelling (inflammation) of the thyroid gland that often results in reduced thyroid function ( chronic thyroiditis ) Thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone ( overactive thyroid , Graves disease ) Itchy rash with bumps and blisters ( dermatitis herpetiformis ) Parathyroid glands in the neck do not produce enough parathyroid hormone ( hypoparathyroidism ) Pituitary gland does not produce normal amounts of some or all of its hormones ( hypopituitarism ) Autoimmune disorder that affects the nerves and the muscles they control ( myasthenia gravis ) Body does not have enough healthy red blood cells ( pernicious anemia ) Testicles cannot produce sperm or male hormones ( testicular failure ) Type I diabetes Loss of brown color (pigment) from areas of the skin ( vitiligo ) Certain rare genetic defects may also cause adrenal insufficiency. Symptoms Symptoms of Addison disease may include any of the following: Abdominal pain Chronic diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting Darkening of the skin Dehydration Dizziness when standing up Low-grade fever Low blood sugar Low blood pressure, especially with a change in body position Extreme weakness , fatigue , and slow, sluggish movement Darker skin on the inside of the cheeks and lips (buccal mucosa ) Salt craving (eating food with a lot of added salt) Weight loss with reduced appetite Symptoms may not be present all the time. Many people have some or all of these symptoms when they have an infection or other stress on the body. Other times, they have no symptoms. Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms. Blood tests will likely be ordered and may show: Increased potassium Low cortisol level Low sodium level Low pH Normal testosterone and estrogen levels, but low DHEA level High eosinophil count Additional laboratory tests may be ordered. Other tests may include: Abdominal x-ray Abdominal CT scan Cosyntropin (ACTH) stimulation test Treatment Treatment with replacement corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids will control the symptoms of this disease. These medicines usually need to be taken for life. Never skip doses of your medicine for this condition because life-threatening reactions may occur. Your provider may tell you to increase your dosage for a short time because of: Infection Injury Stress Surgery During an extreme form of adrenal insufficiency, called adrenal crisis , you must inject hydrocortisone right away. Treatment for low blood pressure is usually needed as well. Some people with Addison disease (or family members) are taught to give themselves an emergency injection of hydrocortisone during stressful situations. Always carry medical ID (card, bracelet, or necklace) that says you have adrenal insufficiency. The ID should also say the type of medicine and dosage you need in case of an emergency. Outlook (Prognosis) With hormone therapy, many people with Addison disease are able to lead a nearly normal life. Possible Complications Complications can occur if you take too little or too much adrenal hormone. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if: You are unable to keep your medicine down due to vomiting. You have stress such as infection, injury, trauma, or dehydration. You may need to have your medicine adjusted. Your weight increases over time. Your ankles begin to swell. You develop new symptoms. While taking treatment, you develop signs of a disorder called Cushing syndrome If you have symptoms of adrenal crisis, give yourself an emergency injection of your prescribed medicine. If it is not available, go to the nearest emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number. Symptoms of adrenal crisis include: Abdominal pain Difficulty breathing Dizziness or lightheadedness Low blood pressure Reduced level of consciousness Alternative Names Adrenocortical hypofunction; Chronic adrenocortical insufficiency; Primary adrenal insufficiency; Addison's disease Images Endocrine glands References Bornstein SR, Allolio B, Arlt W, et al.

Anti-reflux surgery is surgery to tighten the muscles at the bottom of the esophagus (the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach). Problems with these muscles can lead to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This surgery can also be done during a hiatal hernia repair. This article discusses anti-reflux surgery in children. Description The most common type of anti-reflux surgery is called fundoplication. This surgery most often takes 2 to 3 hours. Your child will be given general anesthesia before the surgery. That means the child will be asleep and unable to feel pain during the procedure. The surgeon will use stitches to wrap the upper part of your child's stomach around the end of the esophagus. This helps prevent stomach acid and food from flowing back up. A gastrostomy tube (g-tube) may be put in place if your child has had swallowing or feeding problems. This tube helps with feeding and releases air from your child's stomach. Another surgery, called pyloroplasty may also be done. This surgery widens the opening between the stomach and small intestine so the stomach can empty faster. This surgery may be done several ways, including: Open repair -- The surgeon will make a large cut in the child's belly area (abdomen). Laparoscopic repair -- The surgeon will make 3 to 5 small cuts in the belly. A thin, hollow tube with a tiny camera on the end (a laparoscope) is placed through one of these cuts. Other tools are passed through the other surgical cuts. The surgeon may need to switch to an open procedure if there is bleeding, a lot of scar tissue from earlier surgeries, or if the child is very overweight. Endoluminal fundoplication is similar to a laparoscopic repair, but the surgeon reaches the stomach by going through the mouth. Small clips are used to tighten the connection between the stomach and esophagus. Why the Procedure is Performed Anti-reflux surgery is usually done to treat GERD in children only after medicines have not worked or complications develop. Your child's health care provider may suggest anti-reflux surgery when: Your child has symptoms of heartburn that get better with medicines, but you do not want your child to continue taking these medicines. Symptoms of heartburn are burning in their stomach, throat, or chest, burping or gas bubbles, or problems swallowing food or fluids. Part of your child's stomach is getting stuck in the chest or is twisting around itself. Your child has a narrowing of the esophagus (called stricture) or bleeding in the esophagus. Your child is not growing well or is failing to thrive . Your child has a lung infection caused by breathing contents of the stomach into the lungs (called aspiration pneumonia ). GERD causes a chronic cough or hoarseness in your child. Risks Risks for any surgery include: Bleeding Infection Risks for anesthesia include: Reactions to medicines Breathing problems , including pneumonia Heart problems Anti-reflux surgery risks include: Damage to the stomach, esophagus, liver, or small intestine. This is very rare. Gas and bloating that makes it hard to burp or throw up. Most of the time, these symptoms slowly get better. Gagging. Painful, difficult swallowing , called dysphagia. For most children, this goes away in the first 3 months after surgery. Rarely, breathing or lung problems, such as a collapsed lung. Before the Procedure Always make sure your child's health care team knows about all the medicines and supplements your child is taking, including those you bought without a prescription. A week before surgery, you may be asked to stop giving your child products that affect blood clotting. This may include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), vitamin E, and warfarin (Coumadin). You will be told when to arrive at the hospital. The child should not eat or drink anything after midnight before surgery. Your child may take a bath or shower the night before or the morning of surgery. On the day of surgery, the child should take any medicine that the provider said to take with a small sip of water. After the Procedure How long your child stays in the hospital depends on how the surgery was done. Children who have laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery usually stay in the hospital for 2 to 3 days. Children who have open surgery may spend 2 to 6 days in the hospital. Your child can start eating again about 1 to 2 days after surgery. Liquids are usually given first. Some children have a g-tube placed during surgery. This tube can be used for liquid feedings, or to release gas from the stomach. If your child did not have a g-tube placed, a tube may be inserted through the nose to the stomach to help release gas. This tube is removed once your child starts eating again. Your child will be able to go home once they are eating food, have had a bowel movement and are feeling better. Outlook (Prognosis) Heartburn and related symptoms should improve after anti-reflux surgery. However, your child may still need to take medicines for heartburn after surgery. Some children may need another operation in the future to treat new reflux symptoms or swallowing problems. This may happen if the stomach was wrapped around the esophagus too tightly or it loosens. The surgery may not be successful if the repair was too loose.

Ankle arthroscopy is surgery that uses a tiny camera and surgical tools to examine or repair the tissues inside or around your ankle. The camera is called an arthroscope. The procedure allows your surgeon to detect problems and make repairs to your ankle without making larger cuts in the skin and tissue. This means that you may have less pain and recover more quickly than open surgery. Description You may receive general anesthesia before this surgery. This means you will be asleep and unable to feel pain. Or, you may have regional anesthesia. This means your leg and ankle area will be numbed so that you do not feel any pain. If you receive regional anesthesia, you will also be given medicine to make you very sleepy during the operation. During the procedure, the surgeon does the following: Inserts the arthroscope into your ankle through a small incision. The scope is connected to a video monitor in the operating room. This allows the surgeon to view the inside of your ankle. Inspects all the tissues of your ankle. These tissues include cartilage, bones, tendons, and ligaments. Repairs any damaged tissues. To do this, your surgeon makes 1 to 3 more small incisions and inserts other instruments through them. A tear in a muscle, tendon, or cartilage is fixed. Any damaged tissue is removed. At the end of the surgery, the incisions will be closed with stitches and covered with a dressing (bandage). Most surgeons take pictures from the video monitor during the procedure to show you what they found and what repairs they made. Your surgeon may need to do open surgery if there is a lot of damage. Open surgery means you will have a large incision so that the surgeon can get directly to your bones and tissues. Why the Procedure is Performed Arthroscopy may be recommended for these ankle problems: Ankle pain -- Arthroscopy allows the surgeon to explore what is causing your ankle pain. Ligament tears -- A ligament is a band of tissue that connects bone to bone. Several ligaments in the ankle help keep it stable and allow it to move. Torn ligaments can be repaired or cleaned up with this type of surgery. Ankle impingement -- Tissues in your ankle can become swollen and sore from overuse. This makes it hard to move the joint. Arthroscopy can remove the tissue so you can move your joint. Scar tissue -- This can form after an injury to the ankle. This surgery can remove scar tissue. Arthritis -- Arthroscopy can be used to help reduce pain and improve movement. Cartilage injuries -- This surgery can be used to diagnose or repair cartilage and bone injuries. Loose fragments -- These are pieces of bone or cartilage inside the ankle that can cause the joint to lock up. During arthroscopy these fragments can be removed. Risks Risks of anesthesia and surgery in general are: Allergic reactions to medicines Breathing problems Bleeding, blood clot, or infection Risks of ankle arthroscopy are: Failure of surgery to relieve symptoms Failure of repair to heal Weakness of the ankle Injury to tendons, blood vessels, or nerves Before the Procedure Tell your surgeon what medicines you are taking. This includes medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription. During the 2 weeks before your surgery: You may be asked to temporarily stop taking blood thinners. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve), and other medicines. Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery. If you have diabetes , heart disease, or other medical conditions, your surgeon will ask you to see your health care provider who treats you for these conditions. Tell your provider if you have been drinking a lot of alcohol, more than 1 or 2 drinks a day. If you smoke, try to stop . Ask your provider or nurse for help. Smoking can slow wound and bone healing. Tell your surgeon if you develop a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness before your surgery. If you do get sick, the procedure may need to be postponed. On the day of surgery: Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking before the procedure. Take any medicines you're asked to take with a small sip of water. Follow instructions on when to arrive at the hospital. Arrive on time. After the Procedure You can usually go home the same day after you recover from the anesthesia. You should have someone drive you home. Follow any discharge instructions you're given. These may include: Keep your ankle elevated above your heart for 2 to 3 days to help reduce swelling and pain. You can also apply a cold pack to reduce swelling. Keep your bandage clean and dry. Follow instructions for how to change the dressing. You can take pain relievers, if needed, as long as your provider says it is safe to do so. You will need to use a walker or crutches and keep weight off your foot unless your provider says it is OK to put weight on your foot. You may need to wear a splint or boot for a few weeks or longer to keep the ankle stable as it heals. Outlook (Prognosis) Arthroscopy uses small cuts in the skin. Compared to open surgery, you may have: Less pain and stiffness Fewer complications Faster recovery The small cuts will heal quickly, and you may be able to resume your normal activities in a few days. But, if a lot of tissue in your ankle had to be repaired, it may take several weeks to heal. How quickly you heal depends on how complicated the surgery was. You may be shown how to do gentle exercises as you heal. Or, your surgeon may recommend that you see a physical therapist to help you regain the full use of your ankle.

Alkalosis is a condition in which the body fluids have excess base (alkali). This is the opposite of excess acid ( acidosis ). Causes The kidneys and lungs maintain the proper balance (proper pH level) of chemicals called acids and bases in the body. Decreased carbon dioxide (an acid) level or increased bicarbonate (a base) level makes the body too alkaline, a condition called alkalosis. There are different types of alkalosis. These are described below. Respiratory alkalosis is caused by a low carbon dioxide level in the blood. This can be due to: Fever Being at a high altitude Lack of oxygen Liver disease Lung disease, which causes you to breathe faster ( hyperventilate ) Aspirin poisoning Metabolic alkalosis is caused by too much bicarbonate in the blood. It can also occur due to certain kidney diseases. Hypochloremic alkalosis is caused by an extreme lack or loss of chloride, such as from prolonged vomiting. Hypokalemic alkalosis is caused by the kidneys' response to an extreme lack or loss of potassium. This can occur from taking certain water pills (diuretics). Compensated alkalosis occurs when the body returns the acid-base balance to near normal in cases of alkalosis, but bicarbonate and carbon dioxide levels remain abnormal. Symptoms Symptoms of alkalosis can include any of the following: Confusion (can progress to stupor or coma) Hand tremor Lightheadedness Muscle twitching Nausea, vomiting Numbness or tingling in the face, hands, or feet Prolonged muscle spasms (tetany) Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. Laboratory tests that may be ordered include: Arterial or venous blood gas analysis . Electrolytes test, such as basic metabolic panel to confirm alkalosis and show whether it is respiratory or metabolic alkalosis. Other blood tests may be needed to determine the cause of the alkalosis. Other tests may be needed to determine the cause of the alkalosis. These may include: Chest x-ray Urinalysis Urine pH Treatment To treat alkalosis, your provider needs to first find the underlying cause. For alkalosis caused by hyperventilation, breathing into a paper bag allows you to keep more carbon dioxide in your body, which improves the alkalosis. If your oxygen level is low, you may receive oxygen. Medicines may be needed to correct chemical loss (such as chloride and potassium). Your provider will monitor your vital signs (temperature, pulse, rate of breathing, and blood pressure). Outlook (Prognosis) Most cases of alkalosis respond well to treatment. Possible Complications Untreated or not treated properly, complications may include any of the following: Arrhythmias (heart beating too fast, too slow, or irregularly) Coma Electrolyte imbalance (such as low potassium level ) When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you become confused, unable to concentrate, or unable to "catch your breath." Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if there is: Loss of consciousness Rapidly worsening symptoms of alkalosis Seizures Severe breathing difficulties Prevention Prevention depends on the cause of the alkalosis. People with healthy kidneys and lungs do not usually have serious alkalosis. Images Kidneys References Oh MS, Briefel G, Pincus MR.

Atheroembolic renal disease (AERD) occurs when small particles made of hardened cholesterol and fat spread to the small blood vessels of the kidneys. Causes AERD is linked to atherosclerosis . Atherosclerosis is a common disorder of the arteries. It occurs when fat, cholesterol, and other substances build up in the walls of arteries and form a hard substance called plaque. In AERD, cholesterol crystals break off from the plaque lining the arteries. These crystals move into the bloodstream. Once in circulation, the crystals get stuck in tiny blood vessels called arterioles. There, they reduce blood flow to tissues and cause swelling (inflammation) and tissue damage that can harm the kidneys or other parts of the body. Acute arterial occlusion occurs when the large artery that supplies blood to the kidney suddenly becomes blocked. The kidneys are involved about half of the time that plaque fragments block blood flow to blood vessels. Other body parts that may be involved include the skin, eyes, muscles and bones, brain and nerves, and organs in the abdomen. Acute kidney failure is possible if the blockages of the kidney blood vessels are severe. Atherosclerosis of the aorta is the most common cause of AERD. The cholesterol crystals may also break off during aortic angiography , cardiac catheterization , or surgery of the aorta or other major arteries. In some cases, AERD may occur without a known cause. The risk factors for AERD are the same as risk factors for atherosclerosis, including age, male sex, cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.

Autonomic neuropathy is a group of symptoms that occur when there is damage to the nerves that manage normally automatic body functions. These functions include blood pressure, heart rate, sweating, bowel and bladder emptying, and digestion. Causes Autonomic neuropathy is a group of symptoms. It is not a specific disease. There are many causes. Autonomic neuropathy involves damage to the nerves that carry information from the brain and spinal cord. The information is then carried to the heart, blood vessels, bladder, intestines, sweat glands, and pupils. Autonomic neuropathy may be seen with: Alcohol abuse Diabetes (diabetic neuropathy) Disorders involving scarring of tissues around the nerves Guillain Barré syndrome or other diseases that inflame nerves HIV/AIDS Inherited nerve disorders Multiple sclerosis Parkinson disease Spinal cord injury Surgery or injury involving the nerves Symptoms Symptoms vary, depending on the nerves affected. They usually develop slowly over years. Stomach and intestine symptoms may include: Constipation (hard stools) Diarrhea (loose stools) Feeling full after only a few bites ( early satiety ) Nausea after eating Problems controlling bowel movements Swallowing problems Swollen abdomen Vomiting of undigested food Heart and lungs symptoms may include: Abnormal heart rate or rhythm Blood pressure drop with position that causes dizziness when standing High blood pressure Shortness of breath with activity or exercise Bladder symptoms may include: Difficulty beginning to urinate Feeling of incomplete bladder emptying Leaking urine Other symptoms may include: Sweating too much or not enough Heat intolerance brought on with activity and exercise Sexual problems, including erection problems in men and vaginal dryness and orgasm difficulties in women Small pupil in one eye Weight loss without trying Exams and Tests Signs of autonomic nerve damage are not always seen when your doctor examines you. Your blood pressure or heart rate may change when lying down, sitting, or standing. Special tests to measure sweating and heart rate may be done. This is called autonomic testing. Other tests depend on what type of symptoms you have. Treatment Treatment to reverse nerve damage is most often not possible. As a result, treatment and self-care are focused on managing your symptoms and preventing further problems.

An abortion is a medical procedure that ends an undesired pregnancy by removing the fetus and placenta from the woman's uterus (womb). A medication abortion uses medicine to end an undesired pregnancy. An abortion is not the same as miscarriage . Miscarriage is when a pregnancy ends on its own before the 20th week of pregnancy. Description An abortion procedure involves dilating the opening to the uterus (cervix) and placing a small suction tube into the uterus. Suction is used to remove the fetus and related pregnancy material from the uterus. Before the procedure, you may have the following tests: Pelvic exam to confirm the pregnancy and estimate how many weeks pregnant you are. A urine or blood HCG test to confirm you are pregnant. A blood test to check your blood type. Based on the test result, you may need a special shot to prevent problems if you get pregnant in the future. The shot is called Rho(D) immune globulin (RhoGAM and other brands). An ultrasound test to check how many weeks pregnant you are and the location of the fetus in the uterus. During the procedure: You will lie on an exam table. You may receive medicine (sedative) to help you relax and feel sleepy. Your feet will rest in supports called stirrups. These allow your legs to be positioned so that your health care provider can view your vagina and cervix . Your provider may numb your cervix so you feel little pain during the procedure. Small rods called dilators will be put in your cervix to gently stretch it open. Sometimes laminaria (sticks of seaweed for medical use) are placed in the cervix. This is done the day before the procedure to help the cervix dilate slowly. Your provider will insert a tube into your uterus, then use a special vacuum to remove the pregnancy tissue through the tube. You may be given an antibiotic to reduce the risk of infection. After the procedure, you may be given medicine to help your uterus contract. This reduces bleeding. Why the Procedure is Performed Reasons an abortion might be considered include: You have made a personal decision to not carry the pregnancy. The fetus has a severe birth defect or genetic problem. Your pregnancy may be harmful to your health. The pregnancy resulted after a traumatic event such as rape or incest . The decision to end a pregnancy is very personal. To help you weigh your choices, discuss your feelings with a counselor or your provider. A family member or friend can also be of help. Risks An abortion procedure is very safe. It is very rare to have any complications. Rare risks of an abortion include: Damage to the uterus or cervix Uterine perforation (accidentally putting a hole in the uterus with one of the instruments used) Excessive bleeding Infection of the uterus or fallopian tubes Scarring of the inside of the uterus Reaction to the medicines or anesthesia, such as problems breathing Not removing all of the tissue, requiring another procedure After the Procedure You will stay in a recovery area for a few hours. Your providers will tell you when you can go home. Because you may still be drowsy from the medicines, arrange ahead of time to have someone pick you up. Follow instructions for how to care for yourself at home . Make any follow-up appointments. Outlook (Prognosis) Problems rarely occur after this procedure. Physical recovery usually occurs within a few days, depending on the stage of the pregnancy. Vaginal bleeding can last for a week to 10 days. Cramping most often lasts for a day or two. You can get pregnant before your next period, which will occur 4 to 6 weeks after the procedure. Be sure to make arrangements to prevent pregnancy, especially during the first month after the procedure. You may want to talk with your provider about emergency contraception .

Adenomyosis is a thickening of the walls of the uterus. It occurs when endometrial tissue grows into the outer muscular walls of the uterus. Endometrial tissue forms the lining of the uterus. Causes The cause is not known. Sometimes, adenomyosis may cause the uterus to grow in size. The condition most often occurs in women ages 35 to 50 who have had at least one pregnancy. Symptoms In many cases, there are no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can include: Long-term or heavy menstrual bleeding Painful menstrual periods , which gets worse Pelvic pain during intercourse Exams and Tests The health care provider will make the diagnosis if a woman has symptoms of adenomyosis that are not caused by other gynecologic problems. The only way to confirm the diagnosis is by examining the tissue of the uterus after a surgery to remove it. During a pelvic exam, the provider may find a soft and slightly enlarged uterus. The exam may also reveal a uterine mass or uterine tenderness. An ultrasound of the uterus may be done. However, it may not give a clear diagnosis of adenomyosis. An MRI can help distinguish this condition from other uterine tumors. It is often used when an ultrasound exam does not provide sufficient information to make a diagnosis. Treatment Most women have some adenomyosis as they get close to menopause. However, only a few will have symptoms. Most women do not need treatment. Birth control pills and an IUD that has progesterone can help decrease heavy bleeding. Medicines such as ibuprofen or naproxen can also help manage pain. Surgery to remove the uterus (hysterectomy) may be done in women with severe symptoms. Outlook (Prognosis) Symptoms most often go away after menopause. Surgery to remove the uterus often gets you rid of symptoms completely. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you develop symptoms of adenomyosis.

Antidiuretic blood test measures the level of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in blood. How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed . How to Prepare for the Test Talk to your health care provider about your medicines before the test. Many medicines can affect ADH level, including: Alcohol Diuretics (water pills) Blood pressure medicines Insulin Medicines for mental disorders Nicotine Steroids How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed ADH is a hormone that is produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus . It is then stored and released from the pituitary, a small gland at the base of the brain. ADH acts on the kidneys to control the amount of water excreted in the urine. ADH blood test is ordered when your provider suspects you have a disorder that affects your ADH level such as: Buildup of fluids in your body that are causing swelling or puffiness ( edema ) Excessive amounts of urine Low sodium (salt) level in your blood Thirst that is intense or uncontrollable Certain diseases affect the normal release of ADH. The blood level of ADH must be tested to determine the cause of the disease. ADH may be measured as part of a water restriction test to find the cause of a disease. Normal Results Normal values for ADH can range from 0 to 5.9 pg/mL (0 to 5.4 pmol/L). Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. Most laboratories cannot run this test. Only very specialized laboratories can perform the assay correctly. Serum co-peptin is now commonly used as a substitute for measuring ADH. What Abnormal Results Mean A higher-than-normal level may occur when too much ADH is released, either from the brain where it is made or from somewhere else in the body. This is called the syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH). Causes of SIADH include: Brain injury or trauma Brain tumors Fluid imbalance after surgery Infection in the brain or the tissue that surrounds the brain Infection in the lungs Certain medicines, such as some seizure medicines, pain medicines, and antidepressants Small cell carcinoma lung cancer Stroke A higher-than-normal level of ADH may be found in people with heart failure, liver failure, or some kind of kidney disease. A lower-than-normal level may indicate: Damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland Central diabetes insipidus (a condition in which the kidneys are not able to conserve water) Excessive thirst ( polydipsia ) Too much fluid in the blood vessels (volume overload) Risks There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Multiple punctures to locate veins Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names Arginine vasopressin; Antidiuretic hormone; AVP; Vasopressin References Frasier LL, Keating JJ, Shiroff AM.

Gestation is the period of time between conception and birth. During this time, the baby grows and develops inside the mother's womb. If the baby's gestational age findings after birth match the calendar age, the baby is said to be appropriate for gestational age (AGA). AGA babies have lower rates of problems and death than babies that are small or large for their gestational age . Information Gestational age is the common term used during pregnancy to describe how far along the pregnancy is. It is measured in weeks, from the first day of the woman's last menstrual cycle to the current date. A normal pregnancy can range from 38 to 42 weeks. Gestational age can be determined before or after birth. Before birth, your health care provider will use ultrasound to measure the size of the baby's head, abdomen, and thigh bone. This provides a view on how well the baby is growing in the womb. After birth, gestational age can be measured by looking at the baby. Weight, length, head circumference, vital signs, reflexes, muscle tone, posture, and the status of the skin and hair are assessed. Graphs are available showing the upper and lower normal limits for different gestational ages, from around 25 weeks of gestation through 42 weeks. The weight for full-term infants that are born AGA will most often be between 2,500 grams (about 5.5 pounds [lbs] or 2.5 kilograms [kg]) and 4,000 grams (about 8.8 lbs or 4 kg). Infants weighing less are considered small for gestational age (SGA) Infants weighing more are considered large for gestational age (LGA) Alternative Names Fetal age; Gestation; Development - AGA; Growth - AGA; Neonatal care - AGA; Newborn care - AGA Images Gestational ages References Ball JW, Dains JE, Flynn JA, Solomon BS, Stewart RW.

Alveolar abnormalities are changes in the tiny air sacs in the lungs, called alveoli. Alveoli allow oxygen to enter the blood. They are very thin to let oxygen move from the lungs to the blood vessels, and for carbon dioxide to be removed from the blood vessels to the lungs. Depending on the disease, alveoli may: Collapse Fuse together Develop thickened linings Fill with fluid Fill with blood Fill with pus Get destroyed Once this occurs oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange do not happen normally and lead to different disorders. It requires many alveoli to be destroyed before abnormalities in carbon dioxide and oxygen levels do occur. These changes can be temporary or permanent, depending on the disease.

Acetaminophen (most common brand name Tylenol) is a pain medicine. Acetaminophen overdose occurs when someone takes more than the recommended amount of this medicine. Acetaminophen overdose is one of the most common poisonings. People often think that this medicine is very safe. However, it can be deadly if taken in large doses. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. Where Found Acetaminophen is found in a variety of over-the-counter and prescription pain relievers. Tylenol is a brand name for acetaminophen. Other medicines that contain acetaminophen include: Anacin-3 Liquiprin Panadol Percocet Tempra Various cold and flu medicines Note: This list is not all inclusive. Common dosage forms and strengths: Suppository: 120 mg, 125 mg, 325 mg, 650 mg Chewable tablets: 80 mg Junior tablets: 160 mg Regular strength: 325 mg Extra strength: 500 mg Liquid: 160 mg/teaspoon (5 milliliters) Drops: 100 mg/mL, 120 mg/2.5 mL Adults should not take more than 3,000 mg of single-ingredient acetaminophen a day. You should take less if you are 65 or more years old. Taking more, especially 7,000 mg or more, can lead to a severe overdose problems. If you have liver or kidney disease, you should discuss the use of this drug with your health care provider. Symptoms Symptoms may include: Abdominal pain, upset stomach Appetite loss Coma Seizures Diarrhea Irritability Jaundice (yellow skin and whites of the eyes) Nausea, vomiting Sweating Note: Symptoms may not occur until 12 or more hours after the acetaminophen was swallowed. Home Care There is no home treatment. Seek medical help right away. Before Calling Emergency The following information is helpful for emergency assistance: Person's age, weight, and condition Name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known) Time it was swallowed Amount swallowed However, DO NOT delay calling for help if this information is not immediately available. Poison Control Your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. What to Expect at the Emergency Room The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Blood tests will be done to check how much acetaminophen is in the blood. The person may receive: Activated charcoal Airway support, including oxygen, breathing tube through the mouth (intubation), and ventilator (breathing machine) Blood and urine tests Chest x-ray CT (computerized axial tomography) scan ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing) Fluids through the vein (intravenous or IV) Laxative Medicines to treat symptoms, including an antidote, n-acetylcysteine (NAC), to counteract the effects of the drug People with liver disease are more likely to develop serious complications of acetaminophen overdose. Overdose may be either acute (sudden or short-term) or chronic (long-term), depending on the doses taken, and symptoms may therefore vary. Outlook (Prognosis) If treatment is received within 8 hours of the overdose, there is a very good chance of recovery. However, without rapid treatment, a very large overdose of acetaminophen can lead to liver failure and death in a few days.

The glomerular basement membrane is the part of the kidney that helps filter waste and extra fluid from the blood. Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies are antibodies against this membrane. They can lead to kidney damage. This article describes the blood test used to detect these antibodies. How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed . How to Prepare for the Test No special preparation is necessary. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain, while others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed This test is used to diagnose certain kidney diseases, such as Goodpasture syndrome and anti-glomerular basement membrane disease. Normal Results Normally, there are none of these antibodies in the blood. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean Antibodies in the blood may mean any of the following: Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease Goodpasture syndrome Risks There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.

Alcoholic ketoacidosis is the buildup of ketones in the blood due to alcohol use. Ketones are a type of acid that form when the body breaks down fat for energy. The condition is an acute form of metabolic acidosis , a condition in which there is too much acid in body fluids. Causes Alcoholic ketoacidosis is caused by very heavy alcohol use. It most often occurs in a malnourished person who drinks large amounts of alcohol every day. Symptoms Symptoms of alcoholic ketoacidosis include: Nausea and vomiting Abdominal pain Agitation , confusion Changed level of alertness, which may lead to coma Fatigue , slow movements Deep, labored, rapid breathing Loss of appetite Symptoms of dehydration , such as dizziness, lightheadedness, and thirst Exams and Tests Tests may include: Arterial blood gases (measures the acid/base balance and oxygen level in blood) Blood alcohol level Blood chemistries and liver function tests CBC (complete blood count), measures red and white blood cells, and platelets, which help blood to clot Prothrombin time (PT), measures blood clotting, often abnormal from liver disease Toxicology study (checking for other poisons in your body) Urine ketones Treatment Treatment may involve fluids (salt and sugar solution) given through a vein. You may need to have frequent blood tests. You may get vitamin supplements to treat malnutrition caused by excessive alcohol use. People with this condition are usually admitted to the hospital, often to the intensive care unit (ICU). Alcohol use is stopped to help recovery. Medicines may be given to prevent alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Outlook (Prognosis) Prompt medical attention improves the overall outlook. How severe the alcohol use is, and the presence of liver disease or other problems, may also affect the outlook. Possible Complications This can be a life-threatening condition. Complications may include: Coma and seizures Gastrointestinal bleeding Inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis) Pneumonia When to Contact a Medical Professional If you or someone else has symptoms of alcoholic ketoacidosis, seek emergency medical help. Prevention Limiting the amount of alcohol you drink will help prevent this condition. Alternative Names Ketoacidosis - alcoholic; Alcohol use - alcoholic ketoacidosis References Finnell JT.

The alanine transaminase (ALT) blood test measures the level of the enzyme ALT in the blood. How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed. How to Prepare for the Test No special preparation is needed. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed ALT is an enzyme found in a high level in the liver. An enzyme is a protein that causes a specific chemical change in the body. Injury to the liver results in release of ALT into the blood. This test is mainly done along with other tests (such as AST, ALP, and bilirubin) to diagnose and monitor liver disease. Normal Results The normal range is 4 to 36 U/L. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean An increased ALT level is often a sign of liver disease. Liver disease is even more likely when the levels of substances checked by other liver blood tests have also increased. An increased ALT level may be due to any of the following: Scarring of the liver ( cirrhosis ) Death of liver tissue Swollen and inflamed liver ( hepatitis ) Too much iron in the body ( hemochromatosis ) Too much fat in the liver (fatty liver) Lack of blood flow to the liver (liver ischemia) Liver tumor or cancer Use of drugs that are toxic to the liver Mononucleosis ("mono") Swollen and inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis) Risks There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Multiple punctures to locate veins Hematoma (blood collecting under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names SGPT; Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase; Alanine transaminase; Alanine aminotransferase Images Blood test References Daniels L, Khalili M, Goldstein E, Bluth MH, Bowne WB, Pincus MR.

Asphalt is a brownish-black liquid petroleum material that hardens when it cools. Asphalt cement poisoning occurs when someone swallows asphalt. If hot asphalt gets on the skin, serious injury can occur. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. Poisonous Ingredient The substances in asphalt that can be harmful are: Hydrocarbons Industrial glues Industrial solvents Tar Where Found Asphalt is found in: Road paving materials Roofing materials Tile cements Asphalt may also be used for other purposes. Symptoms Below are symptoms of asphalt poisoning in different parts of the body. EYES, EARS, NOSE, AND THROAT Loss of vision Severe pain in the throat Severe pain or burning in the nose, eyes, ears, lips, or tongue HEART AND BLOOD Collapse Low blood pressure that develops rapidly (shock) LUNGS AND AIRWAYS Breathing difficulty (from breathing in asphalt) Throat swelling (which may also cause breathing difficulty) SKIN Burns Irritation Holes (ulcers) in the skin or tissues under the skin STOMACH AND INTESTINES Blockage in the intestines Blood in the stool Burns of the food pipe (esophagus) Severe abdominal pain Vomiting (may contain blood) Home Care Seek medical help right away. Do not make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to. If the person swallowed asphalt, give them water or milk right away, unless a provider tells you not to. Do not give anything to drink if the person has symptoms that make it hard to swallow. These include vomiting, convulsions, or a decreased level of alertness. Before Calling Emergency Have this information ready: Person's age, weight, and condition Name of the product (ingredients, if known) Time it was swallowed Amount swallowed Poison Control Your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. What to Expect at the Emergency Room The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated. The person may receive: Blood and urine tests. Breathing support, including giving oxygen through a tube through the mouth into the lungs, and a breathing machine (ventilator). Bronchoscopy -- camera placed down the throat to look for burns in the airways and lungs. Chest x-ray. ECG (heart tracing). Endoscopy -- camera placed down the throat to look for burns in the esophagus and the stomach. Fluids through vein (by IV). Products to dissolve the asphalt. Medicines to treat symptoms. Surgery to remove burned skin (debridement). Washing of the skin (irrigation). This may need to be done every few hours for several days. Outlook (Prognosis) How well someone does depends on how much asphalt they swallowed and how quickly they receive treatment. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery. Hot asphalt cools very quickly and is difficult to get off the skin. Serious burns can easily occur from the extreme heat. Construction workers who work with asphalt should wear protective clothing. Asphalt is hard to swallow, but it may cause serious damage. Delayed injury may occur, including a hole forming in the throat, esophagus, or stomach. This can lead to severe bleeding and infection. Surgical procedures may be needed to treat these complications. If asphalt gets in the eye, ulcers may develop in the cornea, the clear part of the eye. This can cause blindness.

The tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach is the esophagus or food pipe. Achalasia makes it harder for the esophagus to move food into the stomach. Causes There is a muscular ring at the point where the esophagus and stomach meet. It is called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Normally, this muscle relaxes when you swallow to allow food to pass into the stomach. In people with achalasia, it does not relax as it should. In addition, the normal muscle activity of the esophagus (peristalsis) is reduced or absent. This problem is caused by damage to the nerves of the esophagus. Other problems can cause similar symptoms, such as cancer of the esophagus or upper stomach, and a parasite infection that causes Chagas disease , which is more common in Mexico and Central and South America. Achalasia is rare. It may occur at any age, but is most common in people ages 25 to 60. In some people, the problem may be inherited. Symptoms Symptoms include: Backflow (regurgitation) of food Chest pain , which may increase after eating, or may be felt as pain in the back, neck, and arms Cough Difficulty swallowing liquids and solids Heartburn Unintentional weight loss Exams and Tests Physical exam may show signs of anemia or malnutrition . Tests include: Esophageal manometry , a test to measure if your esophagus is working properly. Functional luminal imaging probe (FLIP). Creates a high resolution 3D image of your esophagus and its movements. EGD or upper endoscopy, a test to examine the lining of the stomach and esophagus. It uses a flexible tube and camera. Upper GI x-ray . Treatment The goal of treatment is to reduce the pressure at the sphincter muscle and allow food and liquids to pass easily into the stomach. Therapy may involve: Injection with botulinum toxin (Botox) -- This may help relax the sphincter muscles. However, the benefit wears off within a few weeks or months. Medicines, such as long-acting nitrates or calcium channel blockers -- These medicines can be used to relax the lower esophagus sphincter. But there is rarely a long-term solution with medicines to treat achalasia. Surgery (called a myotomy) -- In this procedure, the lower sphincter muscle is cut. This procedure is usually performed using a laparoscope. It can now sometimes be performed during EGD instead of traditional surgery. Widening (dilation) of the esophagus -- This is done during EGD by stretching the LES with a balloon dilator. Your health care provider can help you decide which treatment is best for you. Outlook (Prognosis) The outcomes of surgery and non-surgical treatments are similar. However, depending on the type of achalasia you have, your provider may recommend a particular procedure. More than one treatment is sometimes necessary. Possible Complications Complications may include: Backflow (regurgitation) of acid or food from the stomach into the esophagus (reflux) Breathing food contents into the lungs (aspiration), which can cause pneumonia Tearing (perforation) of the esophagus When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if: You have trouble swallowing or painful swallowing Your symptoms continue, even with treatment for achalasia Prevention Many of the causes of achalasia cannot be prevented. However, treatment may help to prevent complications.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are medicines. They treat heart, blood vessel, and kidney problems. How ACE inhibitors help ACE inhibitors are used to treat heart disease. These medicines make your heart work less hard by lowering your blood pressure. This keeps some kinds of heart disease from getting worse. Most people who have heart failure take one of these medicines or similar medicines. These medicines treat high blood pressure, strokes, or heart attacks. They may help lower your risk for stroke or heart attack. They are also used to treat kidney problems. This can help keep your kidneys from getting worse or even improve the function of your kidneys, especially if you have diabetes. If you have these problems, ask your health care provider if you should be taking these medicines. Types of ACE inhibitors There are many different names and brands of ACE inhibitors. Most work as well as another. Side effects may be different for different ones. Taking Your ACE inhibitors ACE inhibitors are pills that you take by mouth. Take all of your medicines as your provider told you to. Follow up with your provider regularly. Your provider will check your blood pressure and do blood tests to make sure the medicines are working properly. Your provider may change your dose from time to time. In addition: Try to take your medicines at the same time each day. Don't stop taking your medicines without talking to your provider first. Plan ahead so that you do not run out of medicine. Make sure you have enough with you when you travel. Before taking ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or aspirin, talk to your provider. Tell your provider what other medicines you are taking, including anything you bought without a prescription, diuretics (water pills), potassium pills, or herbal or dietary supplements. Don't take ACE inhibitors if you are planning to become pregnant, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding. Call your provider if you become pregnant when you are taking these medicines. Side effects Side effects from ACE inhibitors are unusual. You may have a dry cough. This may go away after a while. It also may start after you have been taking the medicine for some time. Tell your provider if you develop a cough. Sometimes reducing your dose helps. But sometimes, your provider will switch you to a different medicine. Do not lower your dose without talking with your provider first. You may feel dizzy or lightheaded when you start taking these medicines, or if your provider increases your dose. Standing up slowly from a chair or your bed may help. If you have a fainting spell, call your provider right away. Other side effects include: Headache Fatigue Loss of appetite Upset stomach Diarrhea Numbness Fever Skin rashes or blisters Joint pain If your tongue or lips swell, call your provider right away, or go to the emergency room. You may be having a serious allergic reaction to the medicine. This is very rare. When to Call the Doctor Contact your provider if you are having any of the side effects listed above. Also call your provider if you are having any other unusual symptoms. Alternative Names Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors References Mann DL.

An abdominal magnetic resonance imaging scan is an imaging test that uses powerful magnets and radio waves. The waves create pictures of the inside of the belly area. It does not use radiation (x-rays). Single magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images are called slices. The images can be stored on a computer, viewed on a monitor, printed on film or scanned to a disk. One exam produces dozens or sometimes hundreds of images. How the Test is Performed You may be asked to wear a hospital gown or clothing without metal zippers or snaps (such as sweatpants and a t-shirt). Certain types of metal can cause blurry images. You will lie on a narrow table. The table slides into a large tunnel-shaped scanner. Some exams require a special dye (contrast). Most of the time, the dye is given during the test through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. The dye helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly. During the MRI, the person who operates the machine will watch you from another room. The test lasts about 30 to 60 minutes, but it may take longer. How to Prepare for the Test You may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the scan. Tell your health care provider if you are afraid of close spaces (have claustrophobia). You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious. Your provider may also suggest an open MRI, in which the machine is not as close to your body. Before the test, tell your provider if you have: Artificial heart valves Brain aneurysm clips Heart defibrillator or pacemaker Inner ear (cochlear) implants Kidney disease or dialysis (you may not be able to receive contrast) Recently placed artificial joints Certain types of vascular stents Worked with sheet metal in the past (you may need tests to check for metal pieces in your eyes) Because the MRI contains strong magnets, metal objects are not allowed into the room with the MRI scanner. Avoid carrying items such as: Pocketknives, pens, and eyeglasses Watches, credit cards, jewelry, and hearing aids Hairpins, metal zippers, pins, and similar items Removable dental implants How the Test will Feel An MRI exam causes no pain. You may get medicine to relax you if you have a problem lying still or are very nervous. Moving too much can blur MRI images and cause errors. The table may be hard or cold, but you can ask for a blanket or pillow. The machine makes loud thumping and humming noises when turned on. You can wear ear plugs to help reduce the noise. An intercom in the room allows you to speak to someone at any time. Some MRI facilities have televisions and special headphones to help you pass time. There is no recovery time, unless you were given a medicine to help you relax. After an MRI scan, you can go back to your normal diet, activity, and medicines. Why the Test is Performed An abdominal MRI provides detailed pictures of the belly area from many views. It is often used to clarify findings from earlier ultrasound or CT scan exams. This test may be used to look at: Blood flow in the abdomen Blood vessels in the abdomen The cause of abdominal pain or swelling The cause of abnormal blood test results, such as liver or kidney problems Lymph nodes in the abdomen Masses in the liver, kidneys, adrenals, pancreas, or spleen MRI can distinguish tumors from normal tissues. This can help your provider know more about the tumor such as size, severity, and spread. This is called staging. In some cases it can give better information about masses in the abdomen than CT. What Abnormal Results Mean An abnormal result may be due to: Abdominal aortic aneurysm Abscess Cancer or tumors that involves the adrenal glands, liver, gallbladder, pancreas , kidneys, ureters, intestines or bladder Enlarged spleen or liver Gallbladder or bile duct problems Hemangiomas Hydronephrosis (kidney swelling from the backflow of urine) Kidney infection Kidney damage or diseases Kidney stones Enlarged lymph nodes Obstructed inferior vena cava Portal vein obstruction (liver) Blockage or narrowing of the arteries that supply the kidneys Renal vein thrombosis Kidney or liver transplant rejection Cirrhosis of the liver Spread of cancers that began outside the belly Risks MRI does not use ionizing radiation. No side effects from the magnetic fields and radio waves have been reported. The most common type of contrast (dye) used is gadolinium. It is very safe. Allergic reactions are rare but can occur. If you have a history of severe allergic reactions to other medicines you should notify your doctor. In addition, gadolinium can be harmful to people with kidney problems who need dialysis. Tell your provider before the test if you have kidney problems. The strong magnetic fields created during an MRI can cause heart pacemakers and other implants not to work as well. The magnets can also cause a piece of metal inside your body to move or shift.

An audiometry exam tests your ability to hear sounds. Sounds vary, based on their loudness (intensity) and the speed of sound wave vibrations (tone). Hearing occurs when sound waves stimulate the nerves of the inner ear. The sound then travels along nerve pathways to the brain. Sound waves can travel to the inner ear through the ear canal, eardrum, and bones of the middle ear (air conduction). They can also pass through the bones around and behind the ear (bone conduction). The INTENSITY of sound is measured in decibels (dB): A whisper is about 20 dB. Loud music (some concerts) is around 80 to 120 dB. A jet engine is about 140 to 180 dB. Sounds greater than 85 dB can cause hearing loss after a few hours. Louder sounds can cause immediate pain, and hearing loss can develop in a very short time. The TONE of sound is measured in cycles per second (cps) or Hertz (Hz): Low bass tones range around 50 to 60 Hz. Shrill, high-pitched tones range around 10,000 Hz or higher. The normal range of human hearing is about 20 to 20,000 Hz. Some animals can hear up to 50,000 Hz. Human speech is usually 500 to 3,000 Hz. How the Test is Performed Your health care provider may test your hearing with simple tests that can be done in the office. These may include completing a questionnaire and listening to whispered voices, tuning forks, or tones from an ear examination scope. A specialized tuning fork test can help determine the type of hearing loss. The tuning fork is tapped and held in the air on each side of the head to test the ability to hear by air conduction. It is tapped and placed against the bone behind each ear (mastoid bone) to test bone conduction. A formal hearing testing can give a more exact measure of hearing. Several tests may be done: Pure tone testing (audiogram) -- For this test, you wear earphones attached to the audiometer. Pure tones of a specific frequency and volume are delivered to one ear at a time. You are asked to signal when you hear a sound. The minimum volume required to hear each tone is graphed. A device called a bone oscillator is placed against the mastoid bone to test bone conduction. Speech audiometry -- This tests your ability to detect and repeat spoken words at different volumes heard through a head set. Immittance audiometry -- This test measures the function of the ear drum and the flow of sound through the middle ear. A probe is inserted into the ear and air is pumped through it to change the pressure within the ear as tones are produced. A microphone monitors how well sound is conducted within the ear under different pressures. Tympanometry -- A measure of the vibration of the ear drum and middle ear pressure. How to Prepare for the Test No special steps are needed. How the Test will Feel There is no discomfort. The length of time varies. An initial screening may take about 5 to 10 minutes. Detailed audiometry may take about 1 hour. Why the Test is Performed This test can detect hearing loss at an early stage. It may also be used when you have hearing problems from any cause. Normal Results Normal results include: The ability to hear a whisper, normal speech, and a ticking watch is normal. The ability to hear a tuning fork through air and bone is normal. In detailed audiometry, hearing is normal if you can hear tones from 250 to 8,000 Hz at 25 dB or lower. What Abnormal Results Mean There are many kinds and degrees of hearing loss. In some types, you only lose the ability to hear high or low tones, or you lose only air or bone conduction. The inability to hear pure tones below 25 dB indicates some hearing loss. The amount and type of hearing loss may give clues to the cause, and chances of recovering your hearing. The following conditions may affect test results: Acoustic neuroma Acoustic trauma from a very loud or intense blast sound Age-related hearing loss Alport syndrome Chronic ear infections Labyrinthitis Ménière disease Ongoing exposure to loud noise, such as at work or from music Abnormal bone growth in the middle ear, called otosclerosis Ruptured or perforated eardrum Risks There is no risk. Considerations Other tests may be used to determine how well the inner ear and brain pathways are working. One of these is otoacoustic emission testing (OAE) that detects sounds given off by the inner ear when responding to sound. This test is often done as part of a newborn screening. A head MRI may be done to help diagnose hearing loss due to an acoustic neuroma. Alternative Names Audiometry; Hearing test; Audiography (audiogram) Images Ear anatomy References Amundsen GA.

Anti-rust product poisoning occurs when someone breathes in or swallows anti-rust products. These products may be accidentally breathed in (inhaled) if they are used in a small, poorly ventilated area, such as a garage. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. Poisonous Ingredient Anti-rust agents contain different poisonous substances, including: Chelating agents Hydrocarbons Hydrochloric acid Nitrites Oxalic acid Phosphoric acid Where Found Various anti-rust products Symptoms Anti-rust product poisoning can cause symptoms in many parts of the body. EYES, EARS, NOSE, AND THROAT Loss of vision Severe pain in the throat Severe pain or burning in the nose, eyes, ears, lips, or tongue GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM Blood in the stool Burns of the throat (esophagus) Severe abdominal pain Vomiting Vomiting blood HEART AND BLOOD Collapse Low blood pressure Methemoglobinemia (very dark blood from abnormal red blood cells) Too much or too little acid in the blood, which leads to damage in all of the body organs KIDNEYS Kidney failure Many of the most dangerous effects of poisoning from anti-rust products come from inhaling the substance. LUNGS AND AIRWAYS Breathing difficulty Throat swelling (may also cause breathing difficulty) Asphyxia (state of having insufficient oxygen in the blood) Chemical pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung) Secondary bacterial or viral infection Hemorrhagic pulmonary edema Respiratory distress or failure Pneumothorax Pleural effusion Empyema NERVOUS SYSTEM Agitation Coma Confusion Dizziness Incoordination Somnolence Headache Blurred vision Weakness Brain damage from low oxygen level SKIN Burns Irritation Holes ( necrosis ) in the skin or tissues underneath Home Care Seek medical help right away. Do not make a person throw up unless told to do so by the poison control center or a health care professional. If the chemical is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes. If the chemical was swallowed, immediately give the person water or milk, unless instructed otherwise by a health care provider. Do not give water or milk if the person is having symptoms (such as vomiting, convulsions, or a decreased level of alertness) that make it hard to swallow. If the person breathed in the poison, immediately move them to fresh air. Before Calling Emergency Get the following information: Person's age, weight, and condition Name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known) Time it was swallowed Amount swallowed Poison Control Your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. What to Expect at the Emergency Room The provider will measure and monitor your vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. You may receive: Blood and urine tests Breathing support, including a tube through the mouth and into the lungs, connected to a breathing machine (ventilator) Bronchoscopy -- a small camera down the throat to see burns in the airways and lungs Chest x-ray Electrocardiogram (ECG) Endoscopy -- a small camera down the throat to see burns in the esophagus and the stomach Fluids through the vein (by IV) Methylene blue -- a medicine to reverse the effect of the poison Surgical removal of burned skin (skin debridement) Tube through the mouth into the stomach to wash out the stomach ( gastric lavage ) Washing of the skin (irrigation), perhaps every few hours for several days Outlook (Prognosis) How well a person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster the person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery. Swallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Damage continues to occur to the kidneys, liver, esophagus, and stomach for several weeks after the substance was swallowed. The outcome depends on this damage. References Hoyte C. Caustics.

Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a heart defect that is present at birth (congenital). As a baby develops in the womb, a wall (septum) forms that divides the upper chamber into a left and right atrium. When this wall does not form correctly, it can result in a defect that remains after birth. This is called an atrial septal defect, or ASD. Causes Normally, blood cannot flow between the two upper heart chambers. However, an ASD allows this to happen. When blood flows between the two heart chambers, this is called a shunt. Blood most often flows from the left to the right side. When this happens the right side of the heart enlarges. Over time pressure in the lungs may build up. When this happens, the blood flowing through the defect will then go from right to left. If this occurs, there will be less oxygen in the blood that goes to the body. Atrial septal defects are defined as primum or secundum. The primum defects are linked to other heart defects of the ventricular septum and mitral valve . Secundum defects can be a single, small or large hole. They may also be more than one small hole in the septum or wall between the two chambers. Very small defects (less than 5 millimeters or ¼ inch) are less likely to cause problems. Smaller defects are often discovered much later in life than larger ones. Along with the size of the ASD, where the defect is located plays a role that affects blood flow and oxygen levels. The presence of other heart defects is also important. ASD is not very common. Symptoms A person with no other heart defect, or a small defect (less than 5 millimeters) may not have any symptoms, or symptoms may not occur until middle age or later. Symptoms that do occur may begin at any time after birth through childhood. They can include: Difficulty breathing ( dyspnea ) Frequent respiratory infections in children Feeling the heart beat ( palpitations ) in adults Shortness of breath with activity Exams and Tests The health care provider will check how large and severe an ASD is based on the symptoms, physical exam, and the results of heart tests. The provider may hear abnormal heart sounds when listening to the chest with a stethoscope. A murmur may be heard only in certain body positions. Sometimes, a murmur may not be heard at all. A murmur means that blood is not flowing through the heart smoothly. The physical exam may also show signs of heart failure in some adults. An echocardiogram is a test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the heart. It is often the first test done. A Doppler study done as part of the echocardiogram allows the provider to assess the amount of shunting of blood between the heart chambers. Other tests that may be done include: Cardiac catheterization Coronary angiography (for patients over 35 years old) Electrocardiogram (ECG) Heart MRI or CT Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) Treatment ASD may not need treatment if there are few or no symptoms, or if the defect is small and is not associated with other abnormalities. Surgery to close the defect is recommended if the defect causes a large amount of shunting, the heart is swollen, or symptoms occur. A procedure has been developed to close the defect (if no other abnormalities are present) without open heart surgery. Some people with ASDs may be able to have this procedure, depending on the size and location of the defect. The procedure involves placing an ASD closure device into the heart through tubes called catheters. The provider makes a tiny cut in the groin, then inserts the catheters into a blood vessel and up into the heart. The closure device is then placed across the ASD and the defect is closed. Sometimes, open-heart surgery may be needed to repair the defect. This type of surgery is more likely needed when other heart defects are present. People who have a repair to close an ASD should get antibiotics before any dental procedures they have in the period following the procedure. Antibiotics are not needed later on. Outlook (Prognosis) In infants, small ASDs (less than 5 mm) will often not cause problems, or will close without treatment. Larger ASDs (8 to 10 mm), often do not close and may need a repair. Important factors include the size of the defect, the amount of extra blood flowing through the opening, the size of the right side of the heart, and whether the person has any symptoms. Some people with ASD may have other congenital heart conditions. These may include a leaky valve or a hole in another area of the heart. Possible Complications People with a larger or more complicated ASD are at an increased risk for developing other problems, including: Abnormal heart rhythms , particularly atrial fibrillation Heart failure Heart infection (endocarditis) High blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs Stroke When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have symptoms of an atrial septal defect. Prevention There is no known way to prevent the defect. Some of the complications can be prevented with early detection.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder that involves frequent blood clots (thromboses). When you have this condition, your body's immune system makes abnormal proteins that attack the blood cells and lining of the blood vessels. The presence of these antibodies can cause problems with blood flow and lead to dangerous clots in blood vessels throughout the body. Causes The exact cause of APS is not known. Both certain gene changes and other factors (such as an infection) may cause the problem to develop. It is often found in people with other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The condition is more common in women than in men. It is often found in women who have a history of repeated miscarriages. Some people carry the antibodies mentioned above, but do not have APS. Certain triggers may cause these people to have a blood clot, including: Smoking Prolonged bed rest Pregnancy Hormone therapy or birth control pills Cancer Kidney disease Symptoms You may not have any symptoms, even though you have the antibodies. Symptoms that may occur include: Blood clots in the legs , arms or the lungs . The clots can be in either the veins or in the arteries. Recurrent miscarriages or still birth. Rash, in some people. In rare cases, clots suddenly develop in many arteries over a period of days. This is called catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome (CAPS). It can lead to stroke as well as the clots in the kidney, liver, and other organs throughout the body, and gangrene in the limbs. CAPS has a high mortality rate, even with treatment. Exams and Tests Tests for the lupus anticoagulant and antiphospholipid antibodies may be done when: An unexpected blood clot occurs, such as in young people or those with no other risk factors for a blood clot. A woman has a history of repeated pregnancy losses. The lupus anticoagulant tests are blood clotting tests. The antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) cause the test to be abnormal in the laboratory. Types of clotting tests may include: Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) Russell viper venom time Thromboplastin inhibition test Tests for antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) will also be done. They include: Anticardiolipin antibody tests Antibodies to beta-2-glypoprotein I (Beta2-GPI) Your health care provider will diagnose antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) if you have positive test for aPL or the lupus anticoagulant, and one or more of the following events: A blood clot Repeated miscarriages The positive tests need to be confirmed after 12 weeks. If you have a positive test without other features of the disease, you will not have the diagnosis of APS. Treatment The treatment for APS is directed at preventing complications from new blood clots forming or existing clots getting larger. You will need to take some form of blood-thinning medicine. If you also have an autoimmune disease, such as lupus, you will need to keep that condition under control as well. The exact treatment will depend on how severe your condition is and the complications it is causing. ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID ANTIBODY SYNDROME (APS) In general, you will need treatment with a blood thinner for a long time if you have APS. Initial treatment may be heparin. This medicine is given by injection. In most cases, warfarin (Coumadin), which is given by mouth, is then started. It is necessary to frequently monitor the level of anticoagulation. This is most often done using the INR test. If you have APS and become pregnant, you will need to be followed closely by a provider who is an expert in this condition. You will not take warfarin during pregnancy, but will be given heparin shots instead. If you have SLE and APS, your provider may also recommend that you take hydroxychloroquine. Currently, other types of blood thinning medicines are not recommended. CATASTROPHIC ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME (CAPS) Treatment for CAPS that involves a combination of anticoagulation therapy, high doses of corticosteroids, and plasma exchange has been effective in most people. Sometimes IVIG, rituximab or eculizumab is also used for severe cases. POSITIVE TEST FOR LUPUS ANTICOAGULANT OR APL You will not need treatment if you do not have symptoms, pregnancy loss, or if you have never had a blood clot. Take the following steps to help prevent blood clots from forming: Avoid most birth control pills or hormone treatments for menopause (women). DO NOT smoke or use other tobacco products. Get up and move around during long plane flights or other times when you have to sit or lie down for extended periods. Move your ankles up and down when you can't move around. You will be prescribed blood-thinning medicines (such as heparin and warfarin) to help prevent blood clots: After surgery After a bone fracture With active cancer When you need to sit or lie down for long periods of time, such as during a hospital stay or recovering at home You may also need to take blood thinners for 3 to 4 weeks after surgery to lower your risk for blood clots. Outlook (Prognosis) Without treatment, people with APS will have repeat clotting events. Most of the time, outcome is good with proper treatment, which includes long-term anticoagulation therapy. Some people may have blood clots that are hard to control in spite of treatments. This can lead to CAPS, which can be life-threatening. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you notice symptoms of a blood clot, such as: Swelling or redness in the leg Shortness of breath Pain, numbness, and pale skin color in an arm or leg Also talk to your provider if you have repeated loss of pregnancy (miscarriage).

Aging changes occur in all of the body's cells, tissues, and organs. These changes affect all parts of the body, including the teeth and gums. Certain health conditions that are more common in older adults taking certain medicines can also affect oral health. Learn what you can do to keep your teeth and gums healthy in your later years. How Age Can Affect Oral Health Certain changes occur slowly over time in our bodies as we age: Cells renew at a slower rate Tissues become thinner and less elastic Bones become less dense and strong The immune system can become weaker, so infection can occur more quickly and healing takes longer These changes affect tissue and bone in the mouth, which increases the risk for oral health problems in later years. Common Oral Health Problems in Older Adults DRY MOUTH Older adults are more at risk for dry mouth . This can occur because of age, medicine use, or certain health conditions. Saliva plays an important role in maintaining oral health. It protects your teeth from decay and helps your gums stay healthy. When the salivary glands in your mouth don't produce enough saliva, it can increase the risk for: Problems tasting, chewing, and swallowing Mouth sores Gum disease and tooth decay Yeast infection in the mouth ( thrush ) Your mouth may produce a bit less saliva as you get older. But medical problems that occur in older adults are more common causes of dry mouth: Many medicines, such as some used to treat high blood pressure, high cholesterol, pain, and depression , can reduce the amount of saliva you produce. This is probably the most common cause of dry mouth in older adults. Side effects from cancer treatment can cause dry mouth. Health conditions such as diabetes , stroke , and Sjögren syndrome can affect your ability to produce saliva. GUM PROBLEMS Receding gums are common in older adults. This is when the gum tissue pulls away from the tooth, exposing the base, or root, of the tooth. This makes it easy for bacteria to build up and cause inflammation and decay. A lifetime of brushing too hard can cause gums to recede. However, gum disease (periodontal disease) is the most common cause of receding gums. Gingivitis is an early type of gum disease. It occurs when plaque and tartar build up and irritate and inflame the gums. Severe gum disease is called periodontitis . It can lead to loss of teeth. Certain conditions and diseases common in older adults can put them at risk for periodontal disease. Not brushing and flossing every day Not getting regular dental care Smoking Diabetes Dry mouth Weak immune system CAVITIES Dental cavities occur when bacteria in the mouth (contained in plaque) changes sugars and starches from food into acid. This acid attacks tooth enamel and can lead to cavities. Cavities are common in older adults these days in part because more adults are keeping their teeth for their lifetime. Because older adults often have receding gums, cavities are more likely to develop at the root of the tooth. Dry mouth also causes bacteria to build up in the mouth more easily, leading to tooth decay. ORAL CANCER Oral cancer is more common in people older than age 50 and is almost three times greater in men than in women. Smoking and other types of tobacco use are the most common cause of oral cancer. Drinking alcohol in excess along with tobacco use greatly increases the risk for oral cancer. Other factors that may increase the risk for oral cancer include: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (same virus that causes genital warts and several other cancers) Poor dental and oral hygiene Taking medicines that weaken the immune system (immunosuppressants) Rubbing from rough teeth, dentures, or fillings over a long period of time How to Protect Your Teeth and Gum No matter what your age, proper dental care can keep your teeth and gums healthy. Brush twice a day with a soft-bristle toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste. Floss at least once a day. See your dentist for regular check-ups. Avoid sweets and sugar-sweetened beverages. Do not smoke or use tobacco. If medicines are causing dry mouth, talk with your health care provider to see if you may be able to change medicines. Ask about artificial saliva or other products to help keep your mouth moist. When to Call the Doctor You should contact your dentist if you notice: Tooth pain Red or swollen gums Dry mouth Mouth sores White or red patches in mouth Bad breath Loose teeth Poorly-fitting dentures Alternative Names Dental hygiene - aging; Teeth - aging; Oral hygiene - aging Images Gingivitis References Hartshorn JE, Gibson G, Niessen LC.

Acne is a skin condition that causes pimples or "zits." Whiteheads, blackheads, and red, inflamed patches of skin (such as cysts) may develop. Causes Acne occurs when tiny holes on the surface of the skin become clogged. These holes are called pores. Each pore opens to a follicle. A follicle contains a hair and an oil gland. The oil released by the gland helps remove old skin cells and keeps your skin soft. The glands can become blocked with a mixture of oil and skin cells. The blockage is called a plug or comedone. If the top of the plug is white, it is called a whitehead . It is called a blackhead if the top of the plug is dark. If bacteria become trapped in the plug, the body's immune system may react to it, causing pimples. Acne that is deep in your skin can cause hard, painful cysts . This is called nodulocystic acne. Acne is most common in teenagers, but anyone can get acne, even babies. The problem tends to run in families. Some things that may trigger acne include: Hormonal changes that make the skin oilier. These may be related to puberty, menstrual periods, pregnancy, birth control pills , or stress. Greasy or oily cosmetic and hair products. Certain drugs (such as steroids, testosterone , estrogen, and phenytoin). Birth control devices, such as some drug-containing IUDs, can make acne worse. Heavy sweating and humidity. Excessively touching, resting on, or rubbing the skin. Research does not show that chocolate, nuts, and greasy foods cause acne. However, diets high in refined sugars or dairy products may be related to acne in some people, but this connection is controversial. Symptoms Acne commonly appears on the face and shoulders. It may also occur on the trunk, arms, legs, and buttocks. Skin changes include: Crusting of skin bumps Cysts Papules (small red bumps) Pustules (small red bumps containing white or yellow pus) Redness around the skin eruptions Scarring of the skin Whiteheads Blackheads Exams and Tests Your health care provider can diagnose acne by looking at your skin. Testing is not needed in most cases. Bacterial culture may be performed with certain patterns of acne or to check for infection if large pus bumps persist. Treatment SELF-CARE Steps you can take to help your acne : Clean your skin gently with a mild, nondrying soap (such as Dove, Neutrogena, Cetaphil, CeraVe, or Basics). Look for water-based or "noncomedogenic" formulas for cosmetics and skin creams. (Noncomedogenic products have been tested and proven not to clog pores and cause acne in most people.) Remove all dirt or make-up. Wash once or twice a day, including after exercising. Avoid scrubbing or repeated skin washing. Shampoo your hair daily, especially if it is oily. Comb or pull your hair back to keep the hair out of your face. What NOT to do: Try not to aggressively squeeze, scratch, pick, or rub the pimples. This can lead to skin infections, slower healing, and scarring. Avoid wearing tight headbands, baseball caps, and other hats. Avoid touching your face with your hands or fingers. Avoid greasy cosmetics or creams. DO NOT leave make-up on overnight. If these steps do not clear up the blemishes, try over-the-counter acne medicines that you apply to your skin. Follow the directions carefully and apply these products sparingly. These products may contain benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, resorcinol, adapalene, or salicylic acid. They work by killing bacteria, drying up skin oils, or causing the top layer of your skin to peel. They may cause redness, drying, or excessive peeling of the skin. Be aware that benzoyl peroxide containing preparations can bleach or discolor towels and clothing. A small amount of sun exposure may improve acne slightly, but tanning mostly hides the acne. Too much exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet rays is not recommended because it increases the risk for wrinkles and skin cancer. MEDICINES FROM YOUR PROVIDER If pimples are still a problem, your provider can prescribe stronger medicines and discuss other options with you. Antibiotics may help some people with acne: Oral antibiotics (taken by mouth) such as tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and amoxicillin Topical antibiotics (applied to the skin) such as clindamycin, erythromycin, or dapsone Creams or gels applied to the skin may be prescribed: Derivatives of vitamin A such as retinoic acid cream or gel (tretinoin, tazarotene) Prescription formulas of benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid Topical azelaic acid For women whose acne is caused or made worse by hormones: A pill called spironolactone may help. Birth control pills may help in some cases, though they may make acne worse in some women. Minor procedures or treatments may also be helpful: Photodynamic therapy may be used. This is a treatment where a chemical that is activated by blue light is applied to the skin, followed by exposure to the light. Your provider may also suggest chemical skin peeling; removal of scars by dermabrasion ; or removal, drainage, or injection of cysts with cortisone. People who have cystic acne and scarring may try a medicine called isotretinoin. You will be watched closely when taking this medicine because of its side effects. Pregnant women should NOT take isotretinoin, because it causes severe birth defects. Women taking isotretinoin must use 2 forms of birth control before starting the drug and enroll in the iPledge program. Men also need to be enrolled in the iPledge program. Your provider will follow you on this drug and you will have regular blood tests. Outlook (Prognosis) Most of the time, acne goes away after the teenage years, but it may last into middle age. The condition often responds well to treatment, but responses may take 6 to 8 weeks, and acne may flare up from time to time. Scarring may occur if severe acne is not treated. Some people become very depressed if acne is not treated. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if: Self-care steps and over-the-counter medicine do not help after several months. Your acne is very bad (for example, you have a lot of redness around the pimples, or you have cysts). Your acne is getting worse. You develop scars as your acne clears up. Acne is causing emotional stress. If your baby has acne, contact the baby's provider if acne does not clear up on its own within 3 months.

Agoraphobia is an intense fear and anxiety of being in places where it is hard to escape, or where help might not be available. Agoraphobia usually involves fear of crowds, bridges, or being outside alone. Causes Agoraphobia is a type of anxiety disorder. The exact cause of agoraphobia is unknown. Agoraphobia sometimes occurs when a person has had a panic attack and begins to fear situations that might lead to another panic attack. Symptoms With agoraphobia, you avoid places or situations because you do not feel safe in public places. The fear is worse when the place is crowded. Symptoms of agoraphobia include: Being afraid of spending time alone Being afraid of places where escape might be hard Being afraid of losing control in a public place Depending on others Feeling detached or separated from others Feeling helpless Feeling that the body is not real Feeling that the environment is not real Having an unusual temper or agitation Staying in the house for long periods Physical symptoms can include: Chest pain or discomfort Choking Dizziness or fainting Nausea or other stomach distress Racing heart Short of breath Sweating Trembling Exams and Tests Your health care provider will look at your history of agoraphobia and will get a description of the behavior from you, your family, or friends. Treatment The goal of treatment is to help you feel and function better. The success of treatment usually depends in part on how severe the agoraphobia is. Treatment most often combines talk therapy with a medicine. Certain medicines, often also used to treat depression, may be helpful for this disorder. They work by preventing your symptoms or making them less severe. You must take these medicines every day. Do not stop taking them or change the dosage without talking with your provider. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are most often the first choice of antidepressant. Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are another choice. Other medicines used to treat depression or medicines used to treat seizures may also be tried. Medicines called sedatives or hypnotics may also be prescribed. These medicines should only be taken under your provider's direction. Your provider will prescribe a limited amount of these medicines. They should not to be used every day. They may be used when symptoms become very severe or when you are about to be exposed to something that always brings on your symptoms. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of talk therapy. It typically involves 10 to 20 visits with a mental health professional over several weeks or longer. CBT helps you change the thoughts that cause your condition. It may involve: Understanding and controlling distorted feelings or views of stressful events or situations Learning stress management and relaxation techniques Relaxing, then imagining the things that cause the anxiety, working from the least fearful to the most fearful (called systematic desensitization and exposure therapy) You may also be slowly exposed to the real-life situation that causes the fear to help you overcome it. A healthy lifestyle that includes exercise, getting enough rest, and good nutrition can also be helpful. Support Groups You can ease the stress of having agoraphobia by joining a support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. Support groups are usually not a good substitute for talk therapy or taking medicine, but can be a helpful addition. See below for more information and support for people with agoraphobia: Anxiety and Depression Association of America -- adaa.org/supportgroups Outlook (Prognosis) Most people can get better with medicines and CBT. Without early and effective help, the disorder may become harder to treat. Possible Complications Some people with agoraphobia may: Use alcohol or other substances while trying to self-medicate. Be unable to function at work or in social situations. Feel isolated, lonely, depressed, or suicidal. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider to make an appointment if you have symptoms of agoraphobia. If you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org . You can also call 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides free and confidential support 24/7, anytime day or night. You can also call 911 or the local emergency number or go to the hospital emergency room. DO NOT delay. If someone you know has attempted suicide, call 911 or the local emergency number right away. DO NOT leave the person alone, even after you have called for help. Prevention Early treatment of panic disorder can often prevent agoraphobia.

The doctor uses them to guide the baby's head out of the birth canal. The mother will push the baby the rest of the way out. Another technique your doctor may use to deliver the baby is called vacuum assisted delivery . When is a Forceps Delivery Needed? Even after your cervix is fully dilated (open) and you have been pushing, you may still need help getting the baby out. Reasons include: After pushing for several hours, the baby may be close to coming out, but needs help to get through the last part of the birth canal. You may be too tired to push any longer. A medical problem may make it risky for you to push. The baby may be showing signs of stress and need to come out faster than you can push it out on your own Before forceps can be used, your baby needs to be far enough down the birth canal. The baby's head and face must also be in the right position. Your doctor will check carefully to make sure it is safe to use forceps. Most women will not need forceps to help them deliver. You may feel tired and tempted to ask for a little help. But if there is not a true need for assisted delivery, it is safer for you and your baby to deliver on your own. What Will Happen to me During a Forceps-assisted Vaginal Delivery? You will be given medicine to block pain. This may be an epidural block or a numbing medicine placed in the vagina. The forceps will be carefully placed on the baby's head. Then, during a contraction, you will be asked to push again. At the same time, the doctor will gently pull to help deliver your baby. After the doctor delivers the baby's head, you will push the baby the rest of the way out. After delivery, you can hold your baby on your tummy if they are doing well. If the forceps do not help move your baby, you may need to have a cesarean birth (C-section). What are the Risks? Most forceps-assisted vaginal births are safe when they are done correctly by an experienced doctor. They may decrease the need for a C-section. However, there are some risks with forceps delivery. Risks for the mother are: More severe tears to the vagina which may require prolonged healing time and (rarely) surgery to correct Problems with urinating or moving your bowels after delivery Risks for the baby are: Bumps, bruises or marks on the baby's head or face. They will heal in a few days or weeks. The head may swell or be cone-shaped. It should return to normal usually within a day or two. The baby's nerves may be injured by pressure from the forceps. The baby's face muscles may droop if the nerves are injured, but they will go back to normal when the nerves heal. The baby may be cut from the forceps and bleed. This rarely happens. There may be bleeding inside the baby's head. This is more serious, but very rare. Most of these risks are not severe. When properly used, forceps rarely cause lasting problems.

Open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is surgery to fix a widened part in your aorta. This is called an aneurysm. The aorta is the large artery that carries blood to your belly (abdomen), pelvis, and legs. When You're in the Hospital You had open aortic aneurysm surgery to repair an aneurysm (a widened part) in your aorta, the large artery that carries blood to your belly (abdomen), pelvis, and legs. You have a long incision (cut) either in the middle of your belly or on the left side of your belly. Your surgeon repaired your aorta through this incision. After spending 1 to 3 days in the intensive care unit (ICU), you spent more time recovering in a regular hospital room. What to Expect at Home Plan to have someone drive you home from the hospital. Do not drive yourself home. You should be able to do most of your regular activities in 4 to 8 weeks. Before that: Do not lift anything heavier than 10 to 15 pounds (5 to 7 kg) until you see your health care provider. Avoid all strenuous activity, including heavy exercising, weightlifting, and other activities that make you breathe hard or strain. Short walks and using stairs are OK. Light housework is OK. Do not push yourself too hard. Increase how much you exercise slowly. Managing pain Your provider will prescribe pain medicines for you to use at home. If you are taking pain pills 3 or 4 times a day, try taking them at the same times each day for 3 to 4 days. They may be more effective this way. Get up and move around if you are having some pain in your belly. This may ease your pain. Press a pillow over your incision when you cough or sneeze to ease discomfort and protect your incision. Make sure your home is safe as you are recovering . Wound Care Change the dressing over your surgical wound once a day, or sooner if it becomes soiled. Your provider will tell you when you do not need to keep your wound covered. Keep the wound area clean . You may wash it with mild soap and water if your provider says you can. You may remove the wound dressings and take showers if sutures, staples, or glue were used to close your skin, or if your provider says you can. If tape strips (Steri-strips) were used to close your incision, cover the incision with plastic wrap before showering for the first week. Do not try to wash off the Steri-strips or glue. Do not soak in a bathtub or hot tub, or go swimming, until your doctor tells you it is OK. Lifestyle Changes Surgery does not cure the underlying problem with your blood vessels. Other blood vessels could be affected in the future, so lifestyle changes and medical management are important: Eat a heart-healthy diet. Get regular exercise. Stop smoking (if you smoke). Take the medicines your provider has prescribed as directed. These may include medicines to lower cholesterol, control blood pressure, and treat diabetes. When to Call the Doctor Call your provider if: You have pain in your belly or back that does not go away or is very bad. Your legs are swelling. You have chest pain or shortness of breath that does not go away with rest. You experience dizziness, fainting, or you are very tired. You are coughing up blood or yellow or green mucus. You have chills or a fever over 100.5°F (38°C). Your belly hurts or feels distended. You have blood in your stool or develop bloody diarrhea. You are not able to move your legs. Also call your provider if there are changes in your surgical incision, such as: The edges are pulling apart. You have green or yellow drainage. You have more redness, pain, warmth, or swelling. Your bandage is soaked with blood or clear fluid. Alternative Names AAA - open - discharge; Repair - aortic aneurysm - open - discharge References DeAnda A, Worsham J, Mell M. The aorta.

Agitation is an unpleasant state of extreme arousal. An agitated person may feel stirred up, excited, tense, confused, or irritable. Considerations Agitation can come on suddenly or over time. It can last for a few minutes, for weeks, or even months. Pain, stress, and fever can all increase agitation. Agitation by itself may not be a sign of a health problem. But if other symptoms occur, it can be a sign of disease. Agitation with a change in alertness (altered consciousness) can be a sign of delirium . Delirium has a medical cause and should be checked by a health care provider right away. Causes There are many causes of agitation. Some of them are: Alcohol intoxication or withdrawal Allergic reaction Caffeine intoxication Certain forms of heart, lung, liver, or kidney disease Intoxication or withdrawal from drugs of abuse (such as cocaine, marijuana, hallucinogens, PCP, or opiods) Hospitalization (older adults often have delirium while in the hospital) Overactive thyroid gland ( hyperthyroidism ) Infection (especially in elderly people) Nicotine withdrawal Poisoning (for example, carbon monoxide poisoning) Some medicines, including theophylline, amphetamines, and steroids Trauma Vitamin B6 deficiency Agitation can occur with brain and mental health disorders, such as: Anxiety Dementia (such as Alzheimer disease ) Depression Mania Schizophrenia Home Care The most important way to deal with agitation is to find and treat the cause. Agitation may lead to an increased risk of suicide and other forms of violence. After treating the cause, the following measures can reduce agitation: A calm environment Enough lighting during the day and darkness at night Medicines such as benzodiazepines, and in some cases, antipsychotics Plenty of sleep DO NOT physically hold back an agitated person, if possible. This usually makes the problem worse. Use restraints only if the person is at risk of harming themselves or others, and there is no other way to control the behavior. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider for agitation that: Lasts a long time Is very severe Occurs with thoughts or actions of hurting yourself or others Occurs with other, unexplained symptoms If you are thinking about hurting yourself or others, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org . You can also call 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides free and confidential support 24/7, anytime day or night. You can also call 911 or the local emergency number or go to the hospital emergency room. DO NOT delay. If someone you know has attempted suicide, call 911 or the local emergency number right away. DO NOT leave the person alone, even after you have called for help. What to Expect at Your Office Visit Your provider will take a medical history and do a physical examination. To better understand your agitation, your provider may ask you specific things about your agitation. Tests may include: Blood tests (such as a blood count, infection screening, thyroid tests, or vitamin levels) Head CT or head MRI scan Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) Urine tests (for infection screening, drug screening) Vital signs (temperature, pulse , breathing rate, blood pressure) Treatment depends on the cause of your agitation.

Being exposed to sharps (needles and other sharp medical instruments) or body fluids means that another person's blood or other body fluid touches your body. Exposure may occur after a needlestick or sharps injury. It can also occur when blood or other body fluid touches your skin, eyes, mouth, or other mucosal surface . Exposure can put you at risk for infection. What to Do After a needlestick or cut exposure, wash the area with soap and water. For a splash exposure to the nose, mouth, or skin, flush with water. If exposure occurs to the eyes, irrigate with clean water, saline, or sterile irrigant. Report the exposure right away to your supervisor or the person in charge. Do not decide on your own whether you need more care. Your workplace will have a policy about what steps you should take after being exposed. Often, there is a nurse or another health care provider who is the expert on what to do. You will likely need lab tests, medicine, or a vaccine right away. Do not delay telling someone after you have been exposed. You will need to report: How the needlestick or fluid exposure occurred What type of needle or instrument you were exposed to What fluid you were exposed to (such as blood, stool, saliva, or other body fluid) How long the fluid was on your body How much fluid there was Whether there was blood from the person visible on the needle or instrument Whether any blood or fluid was injected into you Whether the fluid touched an open area on your skin Where on your body the exposure was (such as skin, mucous membrane, eyes, mouth, or somewhere else) Whether the person has hepatitis, HIV, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Risk of Illness After exposure, there is a risk you may become infected with germs. These may include: Hepatitis B or C virus (causes liver infection) HIV, the virus that causes AIDS Bacteria, such as staph Most of the time, the risk of becoming infected after exposure is low. But you need to report any exposure right away. Do not wait. References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.

Apgar is a quick test performed on a baby at 1 and 5 minutes after birth. The 1-minute score determines how well the baby tolerated the birthing process. The 5-minute score tells the health care provider how well the baby is doing outside the mother's womb. It also helps measure how well the baby responds if resuscitation is needed right after birth. In rare cases, the test will be done 10 minutes after birth. Virginia Apgar, MD (1909-1974) introduced the Apgar score in 1952. How the Test is Performed The Apgar test is done by a doctor, midwife, or nurse. The health care provider examines the baby's: Breathing effort Heart rate Muscle tone Reflexes Skin color Each category is scored with 0, 1, or 2, depending on the observed condition. Breathing effort: If the infant is not breathing, the respiratory score is 0. If the respirations are slow or irregular, the infant scores 1 for respiratory effort. If the infant cries well, the respiratory score is 2. Heart rate is evaluated by stethoscope. This is the most important assessment: If there is no heartbeat, the infant scores 0 for heart rate. If heart rate is less than 100 beats per minute, the infant scores 1 for heart rate. If heart rate is greater than 100 beats per minute, the infant scores 2 for heart rate. Muscle tone: If muscles are loose and floppy, the infant scores 0 for muscle tone. If there is some muscle tone, the infant scores 1. If there is active motion, the infant scores 2 for muscle tone. Grimace response or reflex irritability is a term describing response to stimulation, such as a mild pinch: If there is no reaction, the infant scores 0 for reflex irritability. If there is grimacing, the infant scores 1 for reflex irritability. If there is grimacing and a cough, sneeze, or vigorous cry, the infant scores 2 for reflex irritability. Skin color: If the skin color is pale blue, the infant scores 0 for color. If the body is pink and the extremities are blue, the infant scores 1 for color. If the entire body is pink, the infant scores 2 for color. Why the Test is Performed This test is done to determine whether a newborn needs help breathing or is having heart trouble. Normal Results The Apgar score is based on a total score of 1 to 10. The higher the score, the better the baby is doing after birth. A score of 7, 8, or 9 is normal and is a sign that the newborn is in good health. A score of 10 is very unusual, since almost all newborns lose 1 point for blue hands and feet, which is normal for after birth. What Abnormal Results Mean Any score lower than 7 is a sign that the baby needs medical attention. The lower the score, the more help the baby needs to adjust outside the mother's womb. Most of the time a low Apgar score is caused by: A difficult birth C-section Fluid in the baby's airway A baby with a low Apgar score may need: Oxygen and clearing out the airway to help with breathing Physical stimulation to get the heart beating at a healthy rate Most of the time, a low score at 1 minute is near-normal by 5 minutes. Apgar scores are not usually measured after 5 minutes. A lower Apgar score does not mean a child will have serious or long-term health problems. The Apgar score is not designed to predict the future health of the child. If the Apgar score is below 7 at the five-minute mark, some providers will check it a few minutes later to assess the effect of any action taken to correct any respiratory or cardiac concerns. If it is rechecked, that typically stops once the Apgar score has reached 7.

An abdominal tap is used to remove fluid from the area between the belly wall and the spine. This space is called the abdominal cavity or peritoneal cavity. How the Test is Performed This test may be done in a health care provider's office, treatment room, or hospital. The puncture site will be cleaned and shaved, if necessary. You then receive a local numbing medicine. The tap needle is inserted 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) into the abdomen. Sometimes, a small cut is made to help insert the needle. The fluid is pulled out into a syringe. The needle is removed. A dressing is placed on the puncture site. If a cut was made, one or two stitches may be used to close it. Sometimes, ultrasound is used to guide the needle. An ultrasound uses sound waves to make the image and not x-rays. It does not hurt. There are 2 kinds of abdominal taps: Diagnostic tap -- A small amount of fluid is taken and sent to the laboratory for testing. Large volume tap -- Several liters may be removed to relieve abdominal pain and fluid buildup and shortness of breath caused by a large volume of ascites. How to Prepare for the Test Let your provider know if you: Have any allergies to medicines or numbing medicine Are taking any medicines (including herbal remedies) Have any bleeding problems Might be pregnant How the Test will Feel You may feel a slight sting from the numbing medicine, or pressure as the needle is inserted. If a large amount of fluid is taken out, you may feel dizzy or lightheaded. Tell the provider if you feel dizzy or lightheaded. Why the Test is Performed Normally, the abdominal cavity contains only a small amount of fluid if any. In certain conditions, large amounts of fluid can build up in this space. An abdominal tap can help diagnose the cause of fluid buildup or the presence of an infection. It may also be done to remove a large amount of fluid to reduce belly pain. Normal Results Normally, there should be little or no fluid in the abdominal space. What Abnormal Results Mean An exam of abdominal fluid may show: Cancer that has spread to the abdominal cavity ( most often cancer of the ovaries ) Cirrhosis of the liver Damaged bowel Heart disease Infection Kidney disease Pancreatic disease (inflammation or cancer) Risks There is a slight chance that the needle could puncture the bowel, bladder, or a blood vessel in the abdomen. If a large quantity of fluid is removed, there is a slight risk of lowered blood pressure and kidney problems. There is also a slight chance of infection.

An abdominal mass is swelling in one part of the belly area (abdomen). Considerations An abdominal mass is often found during a routine physical exam . Most of the time, the mass develops slowly. You may not be able to feel the mass. Locating the mass helps your health care provider make a diagnosis. For example, the abdomen can be divided into four areas: Right-upper quadrant Left-upper quadrant Right-lower quadrant Left-lower quadrant Other terms used to describe the location of abdominal pain or masses include: Epigastric -- center of the abdomen just below the rib cage Periumbilical -- area around the belly button The location of the mass and its firmness, texture, and other qualities can provide clues to its cause. Causes Several conditions can cause an abdominal mass: Abdominal aortic aneurysm can cause a pulsating mass around the navel. Bladder distention (urinary bladder over-filled with fluid) can cause a firm mass in the center of the lower abdomen above the pelvic bones. In extreme cases, it can reach as far up as the navel. Cholecystitis can cause a very tender mass that is felt below the liver in the right-upper quadrant (occasionally). Colon cancer can cause a mass almost anywhere in the abdomen. Crohn disease or bowel obstruction can cause many tender, sausage-shaped masses anywhere in the abdomen. Diverticulitis can cause a mass that is usually located in the left-lower quadrant. Gallbladder tumor can cause a tender, irregularly shaped mass in the right-upper quadrant. Hydronephrosis (fluid-filled kidney) can cause a smooth, spongy-feeling mass in one or both sides or toward the back (flank area). Kidney cancer can sometimes cause a smooth, firm, but not tender mass in the abdomen. Liver cancer can cause a firm, lumpy mass in the right upper quadrant. Liver enlargement (hepatomegaly) can cause a firm, irregular mass below the right rib cage, or on the left side in the stomach area. Neuroblastoma , a cancerous tumor often found in the lower abdomen can cause a mass (this cancer mainly occurs in children and infants). Ovarian cyst can cause a smooth, rounded, rubbery mass above the pelvis in the lower abdomen. Pancreatic abscess can cause a mass in the upper abdomen in the epigastric area. Pancreatic pseudocyst can cause a lumpy mass in the upper abdomen in the epigastric area. Spleen enlargement (splenomegaly) can sometimes be felt in the left-upper quadrant. Stomach cancer can cause a mass in the left-upper abdomen in the stomach area (epigastric) if the cancer is large. Uterine leiomyoma (fibroids) can cause a round, lumpy mass above the pelvis in the lower abdomen (sometimes can be felt if the fibroids are large). Volvulus can cause a mass anywhere in the abdomen. Ureteropelvic junction obstruction can cause a mass in the lower abdomen. Home Care All abdominal masses should be examined as soon as possible by the provider. Changing your body position may help relieve pain due to an abdominal mass. When to Contact a Medical Professional Get medical help right away if you have a pulsating lump in your abdomen along with severe abdominal pain . This could be a sign of a ruptured aortic aneurysm, which is an emergency condition. Contact your provider if you notice any type of abdominal mass. What to Expect at Your Office Visit In nonemergency situations, your provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions about your symptoms and medical history. In an emergency situation, you will be stabilized first. Then, your provider will examine your abdomen and ask questions about your symptoms and medical history, such as: Where is the mass located? When did you notice the mass? Does it come and go? Has the mass changed in size or position? Has it become more or less painful? What other symptoms do you have? A pelvic or rectal exam may be needed in some cases. Tests that may be done to find the cause of an abdominal mass include: Abdominal and pelvic CT scan Abdominal and pelvic ultrasound Angiography Barium enema Blood tests Colonoscopy Esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) Paracentesis Sigmoidoscopy Stool analysis Urine tests X-rays of the chest or abdomen Alternative Names Mass in the abdomen Images Anatomical landmarks adult - front view Digestive system Fibroid tumors Aortic aneurysm References Ball JW, Dains JE, Flynn JA, Solomon BS, Stewart RW.

Amniotic fluid is a clear, slightly yellowish liquid that surrounds the unborn baby (fetus) during pregnancy. It is contained in the amniotic sac. Information While in the womb, the baby floats in the amniotic fluid. The amount of amniotic fluid is greatest at about 34 weeks into the pregnancy (34 weeks gestation ), when it averages 800 mL. About 600 mL of amniotic fluid surrounds the baby at full term (40 weeks gestation). The amniotic fluid constantly moves (circulates) as the baby swallows and "inhales" the fluid, and then releases it. The amniotic fluid helps: The developing baby to move in the womb, which allows for proper bone growth The lungs to develop properly Prevent pressure on the umbilical cord Keep a constant temperature around the baby, protecting from heat loss Protect the baby from outside injury by cushioning sudden blows or movements Too much amniotic fluid is called polyhydramnios . This condition can occur with multiple pregnancies (twins or triplets), congenital anomalies (problems that exist when the baby is born), or gestational diabetes . Too little amniotic fluid is known as oligohydramnios. This condition may occur with late pregnancies, ruptured membranes, placental dysfunction , or fetal abnormalities. Abnormal amounts of amniotic fluid may cause the health care provider to watch the pregnancy more carefully. Removing a sample of the fluid through amniocentesis can provide information about the sex, health, and development of the fetus.

The aldosterone blood test measures the level of the hormone aldosterone in blood. Aldosterone can also be measured using a urine test . How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed . How to Prepare for the Test Your health care provider may ask you to stop taking certain medicines a few days before the test so that they don't affect the test results. Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take. These include: High blood pressure medicines Heart medicines Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Antacid and ulcer medicines Water pills (diuretics) Do not stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider. Your provider may recommend that you eat no more than 3 grams of salt (sodium) per day for at least 2 weeks before the test. Or, your provider may recommend that you eat your usual amount of salt and also test the amount of sodium in your urine . At other times, the aldosterone blood test is done right before and after you receive a salt solution (saline) through the vein (IV) for 2 hours. Be aware that other factors can affect aldosterone measurements, including: Pregnancy High- or low-sodium diet High- or low-potassium diet Eating large amounts of black licorice Strenuous exercise Stress How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed This test is ordered for the following conditions: Certain fluid and electrolyte disorders, most often low or high blood sodium or low potassium Hard to control blood pressure Low blood pressure upon standing (orthostatic hypotension) Discovery of an adrenal nodule on an abdominal CT scan or MRI done for a different reason (incidentaloma) Aldosterone is a hormone released by the adrenal glands . It helps the body regulate blood pressure. Aldosterone increases the reabsorption of sodium and water and the release of potassium in the kidneys. This action raises blood pressure. Aldosterone blood test is often combined with other tests, such as the renin hormone test , to diagnose over- or under-production of aldosterone. The serum potassium and sodium are also often tested along with kidney function. Normal Results Normal levels vary: Between children, teens, and adults Depending on whether you were standing, sitting, or lying down when the blood was drawn Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean A higher than normal level of aldosterone may be due to: Bartter syndrome (group of rare conditions that affect the kidneys) Adrenal glands release too much aldosterone hormone ( primary hyperaldosteronism - usually due to a benign nodule in the adrenal gland) Very low-sodium diet Taking blood pressure medicines called mineralocorticoid antagonists Abuse of diuretics Liver cirrhosis Heart failure Laxative abuse A lower than normal level of aldosterone may be due to: Adrenal gland disorders, including not releasing enough aldosterone, and a condition called primary adrenal insufficiency ( Addison disease ) Very high-sodium diet Risks There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Multiple punctures to locate veins Blood accumulating under the skin (hematoma) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names Aldosterone - serum; Addison disease - serum aldosterone; Primary hyperaldosteronism - serum aldosterone; Bartter syndrome - serum aldosterone References Guber HA, Oprea M, Russell YX .

Avoidant personality disorder is a mental condition in which a person has a lifelong pattern of feeling very: Shy Inadequate Sensitive to rejection Causes Causes of avoidant personality disorder are unknown. Genes or a physical illness that changed the person's appearance may play a role. Symptoms People with this disorder cannot stop thinking about their own shortcomings. They form relationships with other people only if they believe they will not be rejected. Loss and rejection are so painful that these people choose to be lonely rather than risk trying to connect with others. A person with avoidant personality disorder may: Be easily hurt when people criticize or disapprove of them Hold back too much in intimate relationships Be reluctant to become involved with people Avoid activities or jobs that involve contact with others Be shy in social situations out of fear of doing something wrong Make potential difficulties seem worse than they are Hold the view they are not good socially, not as good as other people, or unappealing Exams and Tests Avoidant personality disorder is diagnosed based on a psychological evaluation. The health care provider will consider how long and how severe the person's symptoms have been. Treatment Talk therapy is considered to be the most effective treatment for this condition. It helps people with this disorder be less sensitive to rejection. Antidepressant medicines may be used in addition. Outlook (Prognosis) People with this disorder may develop some ability to relate to others. With treatment this can be improved. Possible Complications Without treatment, a person with avoidant personality disorder may lead a life of near or total isolation. They may go on to develop a second mental health disorder, such as substance use or depression and may be at higher risk for suicide. When to Contact a Medical Professional See your provider or a mental health professional if shyness or fear of rejection overwhelms your ability to function in life and have relationships. If you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org . You can also call 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides free and confidential support 24/7, anytime day or night. You can also call 911 or the local emergency number or go to the hospital emergency room. DO NOT delay. If someone you know has attempted suicide, call 911 or the local emergency number right away. DO NOT leave the person alone, even after you have called for help.

URL of this page: //medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000807.htm Are you getting too much exercise? To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript. Health experts recommend moderate-intensity exercise on most days of the week. So, you may be surprised to learn that you can get too much exercise. If you exercise often and find that you are often tired, or your performance suffers, it may be time to back off for a bit. Learn the signs that you may be exercising too much. Find out how to keep your competitive edge without overdoing it. How too Much Exercise can Hurt To get stronger and faster, you need to push your body. But you also need to rest. Rest is an important part of training. It allows your body to recover for your next workout. When you do not get enough rest, it can lead to poor performance and health problems. Pushing too hard for too long can backfire. Here are some symptoms of too much exercise: Being unable to perform at the same level Needing longer periods of rest Feeling tired Being depressed Having mood swings or irritability Having trouble sleeping Feeling sore muscles or heavy limbs Getting overuse injuries Losing motivation Getting more colds Losing weight Feeling anxiety If you have been exercising a lot and have any of these symptoms, cut back on exercise or rest completely for 1 or 2 weeks. Often, this is all it takes to recover. If you are still tired after 1 or 2 weeks of rest, see your health care provider. You may need to keep resting or dial back your workouts for a month or longer. Your provider can help you decide how and when it is safe to start exercising again. How to Avoid Overtraining You can avoid overdoing it by listening to your body and getting enough rest. Here are some other ways to make sure you are not overdoing it: Eat enough calories for your level of exercise. Decrease your workouts before a competition. Drink enough water when you exercise. Aim to get at least 8 hours of sleep each night. Do not exercise in extreme heat or cold. Cut back or stop exercising when you don't feel well or are under a lot of stress. Rest for at least 6 hours in between periods of exercise. Take a full day off every week. Compulsive Exercising For some people, exercise can become a compulsion. This is when exercise is no longer something you choose to do, but something you feel like you have to do. Here are some signs to look for: You feel guilty or anxious if you do not exercise. You continue to exercise, even if you are injured or sick. Friends, family, or your provider are worried about how much you exercise. Exercise is no longer fun. You skip work, school, or social events to exercise. You stop having periods (women). Compulsive exercise may be associated with eating disorders, such as anorexia and bulimia . It can cause problems with your heart, bones, muscles, and nervous system. When to Call a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you: Have signs of overtraining after 1 or 2 weeks of rest Have signs of being a compulsive exerciser Feel out of control about how much you exercise Feel out of control about how much you eat Your provider may recommend that you see a counselor who treats compulsive exercise or eating disorders. Your provider or counselor may use one or more of these treatments: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) Antidepressant medicines Support groups References Howard TM, O'Connor FG. Overtraining.

The acid loading test (pH) measures the ability of the kidneys to send acid to the urine when there is too much acid in the blood. This test involves both a blood test and urine test. How the Test is Performed Before the test, you will need to take a medicine called ammonium chloride for 3 days. Follow instructions exactly on how to take it to ensure an accurate result. Samples of urine and blood are then taken. How to Prepare for the Test Your health care provider will tell you to take ammonium chloride capsules by mouth for 3 days before the test. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away. The urine test involves only normal urination, and there is no discomfort. Why the Test is Performed This test is done to see how well your kidneys control the body's acid-base balance. Normal Results Urine with a pH less than 5.3 is normal. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean The most common disorder associated with an abnormal result is renal tubular acidosis . Risks There are no risks with providing a urine sample. There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Multiple punctures to locate veins Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names Renal tubular acidosis - acid loading test Images Female urinary tract Male urinary tract References Dixon BP.

Apolipoprotein CII (apoCII) is a protein found in large fat particles that the gastrointestinal tract absorbs. It is also found in very low density lipoprotein ( VLDL ), which is made up of mostly triglycerides (a type of fat in your blood). This article discusses the test used to check for apoCII in a sample of your blood. How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed . How to Prepare for the Test You may be told not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, you may feel some pain, or only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing where the needle was inserted. Why the Test is Performed ApoCII measurements can help determine the type or cause of high blood fats. It is not clear whether the test results improve treatment. Because of this, most health insurance companies will not pay for the test. If you do not have high cholesterol or heart disease or a family history of these conditions, this test may not be recommended for you. Normal Results The normal range is 3 to 5 mg/dL. However, apoCII results are usually reported as present or absent. The examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean High levels of apoCII may be due to a family history of lipoprotein lipase deficiency . This is a condition in which the body does not break down fats normally. Low ApoCII levels are also seen in people with a rare condition called familial apoprotein CII deficiency. This causes chylomicronemia syndrome , another condition in which the body does not break down fats normally. Risks Risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Considerations Apolipoprotein measurements may provide more detail about your risk for heart disease, but the added value of this test beyond a lipid panel is unknown.

Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. There are many types of anemia. Iron helps make red blood cells and helps these cells carry oxygen. A lack of iron in the body may lead to anemia. The medical name of this problem is iron deficiency anemia. Causes Anemia caused by a low iron level is the most common form of anemia . The body gets iron through certain foods. It also reuses iron from old red blood cells. A diet that does not have enough iron is the most common cause of this type of anemia in children. When a child is growing rapidly, such as during puberty, even more iron is needed. Toddlers who drink too much cow's milk may also become anemic because too much cow's milk makes it difficult for the body to absorb iron. Also, children who drink too much cow's milk may not eat enough other healthy foods that have iron. Other causes may be: The body is not able to absorb iron well, even though the child is eating enough iron. Slow blood loss over a long period, often due to menstrual periods or bleeding in the digestive tract. Iron deficiency in children can also be related to lead poisoning . Symptoms Mild anemia may have no symptoms. As the iron level and blood counts become lower, your child may: Act irritable Become short of breath Crave unusual foods (pica) Eat less food Feel tired or weak all the time Have a sore tongue Have headaches or dizziness With more severe anemia, your child may have: Blue-tinged or very pale whites of eyes Brittle nails Pale skin Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform a physical exam. Blood tests that may be abnormal with low iron stores include: Hematocrit Serum ferritin Serum iron Total iron binding capacity (TIBC) A measurement called iron saturation (serum iron level divided by the TIBC value) can help diagnose iron deficiency. A value of less than 15% supports the diagnosis. Treatment Since children only absorb a small amount of the iron they eat, most children need to have 3 mg to 6 mg of iron per day. Eating healthy foods is the most important way to prevent and treat iron deficiency. Good sources of iron include: Apricots Chicken, turkey, fish, and other meats Dried beans, lentils, and soybeans Eggs Liver Molasses Oatmeal Peanut butter Prune juice Raisins and prunes Spinach, kale and other green leafy vegetables If a healthy diet does not prevent or treat your child's low iron level and anemia, your provider will likely recommend iron supplements for your child. These are taken by mouth. Do not give your child iron supplements or vitamins with iron without checking with your child's provider. The provider will prescribe the right kind of supplement for your child. Too much iron in children can be toxic. Supplemental iron is usually prescribed to be taken by mouth, but may also be given intravenously (through a vein). Outlook (Prognosis) With treatment, the outcome is likely to be good. In most cases, the blood counts will return to normal in 2 to 3 months. It is important that the provider finds the cause of your child's iron deficiency. Possible Complications Anemia caused by a low iron level can affect a child's ability to learn in school. A low iron level can cause decreased attention span, reduced alertness, and learning problems in children. A low iron level can cause the body to absorb too much lead. Prevention Eating a variety of healthy foods is the most important way to prevent and treat iron deficiency.

A, B, AB, and O are the 4 major blood types. The types are based on small substances (molecules) on the surface of the blood cells. When people who have one blood type receive blood from someone with a different blood type, it may cause their immune system to react. This is called ABO incompatibility. Due to modern testing techniques, this problem is very rare. Causes The different blood types are: Type A Type B Type AB Type O People who have one blood type may form proteins ( antibodies ) that cause their immune system to react against one or more of the other blood types. Being exposed to another type of blood can cause a reaction. This is important when someone needs to receive a blood transfusion or have an organ transplant. The blood types must be compatible to avoid an ABO incompatibility reaction. For example: People with type A blood will react against type B or type AB blood. People with type B blood will react against type A or type AB blood. People with type O blood will react against type A, type B, or type AB blood. People with type AB blood will not react against type A, type B, type AB, or type O blood. Type O blood does not cause an immune response when it is given to people with type A, type B, or type AB blood. This is why type O blood cells can be given to people of any blood type. People with type O blood are called universal donors. But people with type O can only receive type O blood. Both blood and plasma transfusions must be matched to avoid an immune reaction. Before anyone receives blood, both the blood and the person receiving it are tested carefully to avoid a reaction. Usually, a reaction occurs because of a clerical error causing someone to receive incompatible blood. Symptoms The following are symptoms of ABO incompatible transfusion reactions : Low back pain Blood in urine Chills Feeling of "impending doom" Fever Nausea and vomiting Shortness of breath Increased heart rate Pain at infusion site Chest pain Dizziness Bronchospasm (spasm of the muscles lining the lung; causes cough) Yellow skin and whites of the eyes ( jaundice ) Acute kidney failure Low blood pressure Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform a physical exam. Blood tests will usually show: The bilirubin level is high The complete blood count (CBC) shows damage to red blood cells or anemia The recipient's and donor's blood are not compatible Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and blood creatinine ; in case of renal injury Prolonged prothrombin time or partial thromboplastin time (findings of DIC) Positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) Urine tests show the presence of hemoglobin due to breakdown of red blood cells. Treatment In case of any reaction, transfusion should be stopped immediately. Treatment may also include: Medicines used to treat allergic reactions (antihistamines) Medicines used to treat swelling and allergies (steroids) Fluids given through a vein (intravenously) Medicines to raise blood pressure if it drops too low Outlook (Prognosis) ABO incompatibility can be a very serious problem that can result in death. With the right and timely treatment, a full recovery is expected. Possible Complications Complications that may result include: Kidney failure Low blood pressure needing intensive care Death When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have recently had a blood transfusion or transplant and you have symptoms of ABO incompatibility. Prevention Careful testing of donor and recipient blood types before transfusion or transplant can prevent this problem.

Acute arterial occlusion - kidney: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia Skip navigation An official website of the United States government Here’s how you know Here’s how you know Official websites use .gov A .gov website belongs to an official government

Acute arterial occlusion of the kidney is a sudden, severe blockage of the artery that supplies blood to the kidney. Causes The kidneys need a good blood supply. The main artery to the kidney is called the renal artery. Reduced blood flow through the renal artery can hurt kidney function. A complete blockage of blood flow to the kidney can often result in permanent kidney failure. Acute arterial occlusion of the renal artery can occur after injury or trauma to the abdomen, side, or back. Blood clots that travel through the bloodstream ( emboli ) can lodge in the renal artery. Pieces of plaque from the walls of the arteries can come loose (on their own or during a medical procedure that affects an artery). This debris can block the main kidney artery or one of the smaller vessels. The risk of renal artery blockages increases in people who have certain heart disorders, which make them likely to form blood clots. These include mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation . A narrowing of the renal artery is called renal artery stenosis . This condition increases the risk of a sudden blockage. Symptoms You may not have symptoms when one kidney does not function because the second kidney can filter the blood. However, high blood pressure (hypertension) may come on suddenly and be difficult to control. If your other kidney is not working fully, blockage of the renal artery may cause symptoms of acute kidney failure . Other symptoms of acute arterial occlusion of the renal artery include: Abdominal pain Abrupt decrease in urine output Back pain Blood in the urine Flank pain or pain in the side Symptoms of high blood pressure such as headache, change in vision, and swelling Note: There may be no pain. Pain, if it is present, most often develops suddenly. Exams and Tests The health care provider will not be able to identify the problem with just an exam unless you have developed kidney failure. Tests you may need include: Duplex Doppler ultrasound exam of the renal arteries to test blood flow MRI of the kidney arteries, which can show a lack of blood flow to the affected kidney Renal arteriography shows the exact location of the blockage Ultrasound of the kidney to check kidney size Treatment Some people do not need treatment. Blood clots may get better on their own over time. You may have treatment to open the artery if the blockage is discovered quickly or it is affecting your only working kidney. Treatment to open the artery may include: Clot-dissolving medicines (thrombolytics) Medicines that prevent the blood from clotting (anticoagulants), such as warfarin (Coumadin) Surgical repair of the renal artery Insertion of a tube (catheter) into the renal artery to open the blockage You may need temporary dialysis to treat acute kidney failure. Medicines to lower cholesterol may be needed if the blockage is due to clots from plaque buildup in the arteries. Outlook (Prognosis) Damage caused by arterial occlusion may go away. However, in most cases, it is permanent. If only one kidney is affected, the healthy kidney may take over filtering the blood and producing urine. If you have only one working kidney, arterial occlusion leads to acute kidney failure. This can develop into chronic kidney disease or failure . Possible Complications Complications may include: Acute kidney failure Chronic kidney disease High blood pressure Malignant hypertension When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if: You stop producing urine You feel sudden, severe pain in the back, flank, or abdomen Get emergency medical help right away if you have symptoms of arterial occlusion and have only one working kidney. Prevention In many cases, the disorder is not preventable. The most important way to reduce your risk is to stop smoking. People at risk for developing blood clots may need to take anti-clotting medicines. Taking steps to control diseases related to atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) may reduce your risk.

Aloe is an extract from the aloe plant. It is used in many skin care products. Aloe poisoning occurs when someone swallows this substance. However, aloe is not very poisonous. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. Poisonous Ingredient The substances that can be harmful are: Aloe Aloin Where Found Aloe is found in many different products, including: Burn medicines Cosmetics Hand creams Other products may also contain aloe. Symptoms Symptoms of aloe poisoning include: Breathing difficulty (from breathing in a product that contains aloe) Diarrhea Loss of vision Rash Severe abdominal pain Skin irritation Throat swelling (which may also cause breathing difficulty) Vomiting Home Care Stop using the product. Seek medical help right way. DO NOT make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to. Before Calling Emergency Have this information ready: Person's age, weight, and condition Name of the product (ingredients, if known) Time it was swallowed Amount swallowed Poison Control Your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. What to Expect at the Emergency Room Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible. The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated. The person may receive: Blood and urine tests Chest x-ray Fluids by IV (through a vein) Medicines to treat symptoms Outlook (Prognosis) How well someone does depends on how much aloe they swallowed and how quickly they receive treatment. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery. Aloe is not very poisonous. Treatment is usually not needed. However, if you swallow it, you will likely have diarrhea.

An abnormal lack of sweat in response to heat may be harmful because sweating allows heat to be released from the body. The medical term for absent sweating is anhidrosis. Considerations Anhidrosis sometimes goes unrecognized until a substantial amount of heat or exertion fails to cause sweating. Overall lack of sweating can be life threatening because the body will overheat. If the lack of sweating happens in a small area only, it is usually not as dangerous. Causes Cause of anhidrosis may include: Burns Brain tumor Certain genetic syndromes Certain nerve problems (neuropathies) Congenital disorders including ectodermal dysplasia Dehydration Nervous system disorders such as Guillain-Barré syndrome Skin diseases or scarring of the skin that block sweat glands Trauma to sweat glands Use of certain drugs Home Care If there is a danger of overheating, take the following measures: Take a cool shower or sit in a bathtub with cool water Drink plenty of fluids Stay in a cool environment Move slowly DO NOT do heavy exercise When to Contact a Medical Professional Call your health care provider if you have a general lack of sweating or an abnormal lack of sweating when exposed to heat or strenuous exercise. What to Expect at Your Office Visit Your provider will perform a physical exam. In emergencies, the health care team will perform rapid cooling measures and give you fluids to stabilize you. You may be asked about your symptoms and medical history. You may be asked to wrap yourself in an electric blanket or sit in a sweatbox while the health care team watches your body's reaction. Other tests to cause and measure sweating may also be done. A skin biopsy may be done. Genetic testing may be done if appropriate. Treatment depends on the cause of your lack of sweating. You may be given medicine to cause sweating. Alternative Names Decreased sweating; Anhidrosis References James WD, Elston DM, Treat JR, Rosenbach MA, Neuhaus IM. Diseases of the skin appendages.

An antibody is a protein produced by the body's immune system when it detects harmful substances, called antigens. Examples of antigens include microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses) and chemicals. Antibodies may be produced when the immune system mistakenly considers healthy tissue a harmful substance. This is called an autoimmune disorder . Each type of antibody is unique and defends the body against one specific type of antigen. Images Antibodies References Abbas AK, Lichtman AH, Pillai S. Antibodies and antigens.

Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD) is a group of inherited conditions that affect the tubules of the kidneys, causing the kidneys to gradually lose their ability to work. Causes ADTKD is caused by mutations in certain genes. These gene problems are passed down through families (inherited) in an autosomal dominant pattern . This means the abnormal gene is needed from only one parent in order to inherit the disease. Often, many family members have the disease. With all forms of ADTKD, as the disease progresses, the kidney tubules are damaged. These are the structures in the kidneys that allow most fluid in the blood to be filtered and returned to the blood. The abnormal genes that cause the different forms of ADTKD are: UMOD gene -- causes ADTKD- UMOD , or uromodulin kidney disease MUC1 gene -- causes ADTKD- MUC1 , or mucin-1 kidney disease REN gene -- causes ADTKD- REN , or familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy type 2 (FJHN2) HNF1B gene -- causes ADTKD- HNF1B , or maturity-onset diabetes mellitus of the young type 5 (MODY5) When the cause of ADTKD is not known or a genetic test has not been done, it is called ADTKD-NOS. Symptoms Early in the disease, depending on the form of ADTKD, symptoms may include: Excessive urination (polyuria) Gout Salt cravings Urination at night (nocturia) Weakness As the disease worsens, symptoms of kidney failure may develop, which include: Easy bruising or bleeding Fatigue , weakness Frequent hiccups Headache Increased skin color (skin may appear yellow or brown) Itching Malaise (general ill feeling) Muscle twitching or cramps Nausea Pale skin Reduced sensation in the hands, feet, or other areas Vomiting blood or blood in the stool Weight loss Seizures Confusion, decreased alertness, coma Exams and Tests Your health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms. You'll likely be asked if other family members have ADTKD or kidney disease. Tests that may be done include: 24-hour urine volume and electrolytes Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Complete blood count (CBC) Creatinine blood test Creatinine clearance -- blood and urine Uric acid blood test Urine specific gravity (will be low) The following tests can help diagnose this condition: Abdominal CT scan Abdominal ultrasound Kidney biopsy Kidney ultrasound Treatment There is no cure for ADTKD. At first, treatment focuses on controlling symptoms, reducing complications, and slowing the progression of the disease. Because so much water and salt may be lost, you may need to follow instructions on drinking plenty of fluids and taking salt supplements to avoid dehydration. As the disease progresses, kidney failure develops. Treatment may involve taking medicines and diet changes, limiting foods containing phosphorus and potassium. You may need dialysis and a kidney transplant. Outlook (Prognosis) The age at which people with ADTKD reach end-stage kidney disease varies, depending on the form of the disease. It can be as young as in the teens or in older adulthood. Lifelong treatment may control the symptoms of chronic kidney disease. Possible Complications Kidney damage due to ADTKD may lead to the following health problems: Anemia Bone weakening and fractures Cardiac tamponade Changes in glucose metabolism Congestive heart failure End-stage kidney disease High blood pressure Hyponatremia (low blood sodium level) Hyperkalemia (too much potassium in the blood), especially with end-stage kidney disease Hypokalemia (too little potassium in the blood) Infertility Menstrual problems Miscarriage Pericarditis Peripheral neuropathy Platelet dysfunction with easy bruising Skin color changes When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have any symptoms of urinary or kidney problems. Prevention Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease is an inherited disorder. It may not be preventable.

Angelman syndrome (AS) is a genetic condition that causes problems with the way a child's body and brain develop. The syndrome is present from birth (congenital). However, it often isn't diagnosed until about 6 to 12 months of age. This is when development problems are first noticed in most cases. Causes This condition involves the gene UBE3A . Most genes come in pairs. Children receive one from each parent. In most cases, both genes are active. This means information from both genes is used by the cells. With the UBE3A gene, both parents pass it on, but only the gene passed on from the mother is active. Angelman syndrome most often occurs because the UBE3A gene passed on from the mother doesn't work the way it should. In some cases, AS is caused when two copies of the UBE3A gene come from the father, and none come from the mother. This means neither gene is active, because they both come from the father. Symptoms In newborns and infants: Loss of muscle tone (floppiness) Trouble feeding Heartburn (acid reflux) Trembling arm and leg movements In toddlers and older children: Unstable or jerky walking Little or no speech Happy, excitable personality Laughing and smiling often Light hair, skin, and eye color compared to rest of family Small head size compared to body, flattened back of head Severe intellectual disability Seizures Excessive movement of the hands and limbs Sleep problems Tongue thrusting, drooling Unusual chewing and mouthing movements Crossed eyes Walking with arms uplifted and hands waving Most children with this disorder don't show symptoms until about 6 to 12 months. This is when parents may notice a delay in their child's development, such as not crawling or starting to talk. Children between 2 and 5 years of age start to show symptoms such as jerky walking, happy personality, laughing often, no speech, and intellectual problems. Exams and Tests Genetic tests may diagnose Angelman syndrome. These tests look for: Missing pieces of chromosomes Specific DNA to see if copies of the gene from both parents are in an inactive or active state A gene variant in the copy of the gene inherited from the mother Other tests may include: Brain MRI EEG Treatment There is no cure for Angelman syndrome. Treatment helps to manage health and development problems caused by the condition. Anticonvulsant medicines help control seizures Behavior therapy helps manage hyperactivity, sleep problems, and development problems Occupational and speech therapy manage speech problems and teach living skills Physical therapy helps with walking and movement problems Support Groups More information and support for people with Angelman syndrome and their families can be found at: Angelman Syndrome Foundation -- www.angelman.org AngelmanUK -- www.angelmanuk.org Outlook (Prognosis) People with AS live close to a normal lifespan. Many have friendships and interact socially. Treatment helps improve function. People with AS can't live on their own. However, they may be able to learn certain tasks and live with others in a supervised setting. Possible Complications Complications may include: Severe seizures Gastroesophageal reflux (heartburn) Scoliosis (curved spine) Accidental injury due to uncontrolled movements When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your health care provider if your child has symptoms of this condition. Prevention There is no way to prevent Angelman syndrome. If you have a child with AS or a family history of the condition, you may want to talk with your provider before becoming pregnant.

The adrenal glands are two small triangle-shaped glands in the upper abdomen. One gland is located on top of each kidney. Information Each adrenal gland is about the size of the top part of the thumb. The outer part of the gland is called the cortex. It produces steroid hormones such as cortisol, aldosterone, and hormones that can be changed into testosterone. The inner part of the gland is called the medulla. It produces epinephrine and norepinephrine. These hormones are also called adrenaline and noradrenaline. When the glands produce more or less hormones than normal, you can become sick. This might happen at birth or later in life. The adrenal glands can be affected by many diseases, such as autoimmune disorders , infections, tumors , and bleeding. Some are permanent and some go away over time. Medicines can also affect the adrenal glands. The pituitary, a small gland at the bottom of the brain, releases a hormone called ACTH that stimulates the adrenal cortex to make its hormones. Pituitary diseases can lead to problems with adrenal function. Conditions related to adrenal gland problems include: Addison disease , also called adrenal insufficiency -- an autoimmune disorder that causes the adrenal glands to not produce enough hormones Congenital adrenal hyperplasia -- disorder in which the adrenal glands lack an enzyme needed to make certain hormones Cushing syndrome -- disorder that occurs when the body has a high level of the hormone cortisol Diabetes mellitus (high blood sugar) caused by the adrenal gland making too much cortisol Glucocorticoid medicines such as prednisone, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone Excessive or unwanted hair in women ( hirsutism ) Hump behind shoulders (dorsocervical fat pad) Hypoglycemia -- low blood sugar Primary aldosteronism (Conn syndrome) -- disorder in which the adrenal gland releases too much of the hormone aldosterone Massive bilateral adrenal hemorrhage ( Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome ) -- failure of adrenal glands to function as a result of bleeding into the gland, usually associated with severe infection, called sepsis Images Endocrine glands Adrenal glands Adrenal gland biopsy References Friedman TC.

Aging spots, also called liver spots or solar lentigos, are very common. They are most often not a cause for worry. They typically develop in people with fair complexions, but people with darker skin can also get them. Aging spots are flat and oval and tan, brown, or black marks. They appear on skin that has been the most exposed to sun over the years, such as the backs of hands, tops of feet, face, shoulders, and upper back. Always let your health care provider know if you have any new or unusual spots, and have them checked. Skin cancers may have many different appearances. Spots or sores related to skin cancers can be: Small, shiny, or waxy Scaly and rough Firm and red Crusty or bleeding Skin cancers can also have other features.

Acute flaccid myelitis is a rare condition that affects the nervous system. Inflammation of the gray matter in the spinal cord leads to muscle weakness and paralysis. Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is usually caused by infection with a virus. While AFM is rare, there has been a slight increase in cases of AFM since 2014. Most new cases have occurred in children or young adults. Causes AFM usually occurs after a cold, fever, or gastrointestinal illness. Different kinds of viruses may be the cause of AFM. These include: Enteroviruses (poliovirus and non-poliovirus) West Nile virus and similar viruses such as Japanese encephalitis virus and Saint Louis encephalitis virus Adenoviruses It is unclear why certain viruses trigger AFM, or why some people develop the condition and others don't. Environmental toxins also can cause AFM. In many cases, a cause is never found. Symptoms A fever or a respiratory illness is often present before weakness and other symptoms begin. AFM symptoms often start with sudden muscle weakness and loss of reflexes in an arm or leg. Symptoms may progress rapidly over a few hours to days. Other symptoms may include: Facial droop or weakness Drooping eyelids Difficulty moving the eyes Slurred speech or difficulty swallowing Some people may have: Stiffness in the neck Pain in the arms or legs Inability to pass urine Severe symptoms include: Respiratory failure, when muscles involved in breathing become weak Serious nervous system problems, which may lead to death Exams and Tests Your health care provider will take your medical history and vaccination history to know if you are up-to-date with your polio vaccines. Unvaccinated individuals who are exposed to poliovirus are at higher risk for acute flaccid myelitis. Your provider also may want to know if within the last 4 weeks you have: Traveled Had a cold or the flu or a stomach bug Had a fever 100°F (38°C) or higher Your provider will do a physical exam. Tests that may be done include: MRI of spine and MRI of the brain to view lesions in the gray matter Nerve conduction velocity test Electromyography (EMG) Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis to check if white blood cells are elevated Your provider also may take stool, blood, and saliva samples to test. Treatment There is no specific treatment for AFM. You may be referred to a doctor specializing in disorders of the nerves and nervous system (neurologist). The doctor will likely treat your symptoms. A number of medicines and treatments that work on the immune system have been tried but have not been found to help. You may need physical therapy to help restore muscle function. Outlook (Prognosis) The long-term outlook of AFM is not known. Possible Complications Complications of AFM include: Muscle weakness and paralysis Loss of limb function When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider right away if you or your child have: Sudden weakness in the arms or legs or difficulty moving the head or face Any other symptom of AFM Prevention There is no known way to prevent AFM. Having a polio vaccine may help reduce the risk of AFM related to the poliovirus. Take these steps to help avoid viral infections: Wash hands frequently with soap and water, especially before eating. Avoid close contact with people who have a viral infection. Use mosquito repellants when going outdoors to prevent mosquito bites.

An animal bite can break, puncture, or tear the skin. Bites that break the skin put you at risk for infections. Causes Most animal bites come from pets. Dog bites are common and most often happen to children. Compared with adults, children are much more likely to be bitten on the face, head, or neck. Cat bites are less common but have a higher risk for infection. Cat teeth are longer and sharper, which can cause deeper puncture wounds. Most other animal bites are caused by stray or wild animals, such as skunks, raccoons, foxes, and bats. Bites that cause a puncture wound are more likely to become infected. Some animals are infected with a virus that can cause rabies . Rabies is rare but is often deadly. Symptoms Pain, bleeding, numbness and tingling may occur with any animal bite. The bite may also result in: Breaks or major cuts in the skin, with or without bleeding Bruising (discoloration of the skin) Crushing injuries that can cause severe tissue tears and scarring Puncture wounds Tendon or joint injury resulting in decreased motion and function of the injured tissue Wound Care You should get medical attention within 24 hours for any bite that breaks the skin: You may need stitches for deeper wounds. You may need to get a tetanus shot. You may need to take antibiotics due to the risk for infection or receive antibiotics through a vein ( IV ) if the infection has spread. You may need surgery to repair the damage from a bad bite. If you are caring for someone who was bitten: Calm and reassure the person. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before treating the wound. If the wound is bleeding, put on latex gloves if you have them. Wash your hands again afterward. To care for a bite wound: Stop the wound from bleeding by applying direct pressure with a clean, dry cloth. Wash the wound. Use mild soap and warm, running water. Rinse the bite for 3 to 5 minutes. Apply an antibacterial ointment to the wound. This may help reduce the risk for infection. Put on a dry, sterile bandage. Contact your health care provider right away if the bite is on your neck, head, face, hand, fingers, or feet. When to Call Animal Control You should contact animal control or your local police if you are bitten by: An animal that behaves in an odd way An unknown pet or a pet that has not had a rabies vaccination A stray or wild animal Tell them what the animal looks like and where it is. They will decide whether the animal needs to be captured and isolated. Possible Complications Most animal bites will heal without developing infection or decreased tissue function. Ask your provider if you should take an antibiotic to reduce the chance of an infection. Some wounds will require surgery to properly clean and close, and even some minor bites may need stitches. Deep or extensive wounds may result in significant scarring. Complications from bite wounds include: An infection that spreads quickly Damage to tendons or joints An animal bite is more likely to become infected in people who have: Weakened immune systems due to medicines or disease Diabetes Peripheral arterial disease ( arteriosclerosis , or poor circulation) Getting a rabies shot right after you are bitten can protect you from the disease. How to Prevent Animal Bites To prevent animal bites: Teach children not to approach strange animals. Do not provoke or tease animals. Do not go near an animal that is acting strangely or aggressively. It may have rabies. Do not try to catch the animal yourself. When to Call the Doctor Wild animals and unknown pets could be carrying rabies. If you have been bitten by a wild or stray animal, contact your provider right away. See your provider within 24 hours for any bite that breaks the skin. Contact your provider or go to the emergency room if: There is swelling, redness, or pus draining from the wound. The bite is on the head, face, neck, hands, or feet. The bite is deep or large. You see exposed muscle or bone. You are not sure if the wound needs stitches. The bleeding does not stop after a few minutes. For serious bleeding, call 911 or the local emergency number. You have not had a tetanus shot in 5 years. You notice red streaks that spread out from the wound. Alternative Names Bites - animals - self-care Images Animal bite Animal bites Animal bite - first aid - series References Eilbert WP.

Astigmatism is a type of refractive error of the eye. Refractive errors cause blurred vision. They are the most common reason why a person goes to see an eye professional. Other types of refractive errors are: Farsightedness Nearsightedness Causes People are able to see because the front part of the eye (cornea) is able to bend (refract) light and focus it onto the retina. This is the back inside surface of the eye. If the light rays are not clearly focused on the retina, the images you see may be blurry. With astigmatism, the cornea is abnormally curved. This curve causes vision to be out of focus. The cause of astigmatism is unknown. It is most often present from birth. Astigmatism often occurs together with nearsightedness or farsightedness. If astigmatism gets worse, it may be a sign of keratoconus . Astigmatism is very common. It sometimes occurs after certain types of eye surgery, such as cataract surgery . Symptoms Astigmatism makes it hard to see fine details, either close up or from a distance. Exams and Tests Astigmatism is easily diagnosed by a standard eye exam with refraction test . Special tests are not required in most cases. Children or adults who cannot respond to a normal refraction test can have their refraction measured by a test that uses reflected light (retinoscopy). Treatment Mild astigmatism may not need to be corrected. Glasses or contact lenses will correct astigmatism, but do not cure it. Laser surgery can help change the shape of the cornea surface to eliminate astigmatism, along with nearsightedness or farsightedness. Outlook (Prognosis) Astigmatism may change with time, requiring new glasses or contact lenses. Laser vision correction can most often eliminate, or greatly reduce astigmatism. Possible Complications In children, uncorrected astigmatism in only one eye may cause amblyopia . When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your health care provider or ophthalmologist if vision problems worsen, or do not improve with glasses or contact lenses.

Most women will remain in the hospital for 2 to 3 days after a cesarean birth ( C-section ). Take advantage of the time to bond with your new baby, get some rest, and receive some help with breastfeeding and caring for your baby. What to Expect after a C-section Right after surgery you may feel: Groggy from any medicines you received Nausea for the first day or so Itchy, if you received narcotics in your epidural You will be brought to a recovery area right after surgery, where a nurse will: Monitor your blood pressure, heart rate, and the amount of your vaginal bleeding Check to make sure your uterus is becoming firmer Bring you to a hospital room once you are stable, where you will spend the next few days After the excitement of finally delivering and holding your baby, you may notice just how tired you are. Your belly will be painful at first, but it will improve a lot over 1 to 2 days. Some women feel sadness or an emotional letdown after delivery. These feelings are not uncommon. Do not feel ashamed. Talk with your health care providers and partner. Seeing and Caring for Your Baby Breastfeeding can often begin right after surgery. The nurses can help you find the right position. Numbness from your anesthetic can limit your movement for a while, and pain in your cut (incision) can make it a little harder to become comfortable, but do not give up. The nurses can show you how to hold your baby so there is no pressure on your cut (incision) or abdomen. Holding and caring for your new infant is exciting, making up for the long journey of your pregnancy and the pain and discomfort of labor. Nurses and breastfeeding specialists are available to answer questions and help you. Also take advantage of the babysitting and room service the hospital provides for you. You are going home to both the joys of being a mother and the demands of caring for a newborn infant. Activity Between feeling exhausted after labor and managing the pain from the surgery, getting out of bed may seem like too big of a task. But getting out of bed at least once or twice a day at first can help speed your recovery. It also decreases your chance of having blood clots and helps your bowels move. Make sure someone is around to help you in case you get dizzy or weak. Plan on taking your walks soon after you have received some pain medicine. Contractions and Bleeding Once you deliver, the heavy contractions are over. But your uterus still needs to contract to shrink back to its normal size and prevent heavy bleeding. Breastfeeding also helps your uterus contract. These contractions may be somewhat painful, but they are important. As your uterus becomes firmer and smaller, you are less likely to have heavy bleeding. Blood flow should gradually become slower during your first day. You may notice a few smaller clots passing when the nurse presses on your uterus to check it. Pain Relief Your epidural, or spinal, catheter can also be used for pain relief after surgery . It may be left in for up to 24 hours after delivery. If you did not have an epidural, you may receive pain medicines directly into your veins through an intravenous line (IV) after surgery. This line runs through a pump that will be set to give you a certain amount of pain medicine. Often, you can push a button to give yourself more pain relief when you need it. This is called patient controlled analgesia (PCA). You will then be switched to pain pills that you take by mouth, or you may receive shots of medicine. It is OK to ask for pain medicine when you need it. What Else? You will have a urinary (Foley) catheter in place right after surgery, but this will be removed on the first day after surgery. The area around your cut (incision) may be sore, numb, or both. Sutures or staples are often removed around the second day, just before you leave the hospital. At first you may be asked to only eat ice chips or take sips of water, at least until your provider is certain you are not likely to have very heavy bleeding. Most likely, you will be able to eat a light diet 8 hours after your C-section.

Achondrogenesis is a rare type of growth hormone deficiency in which there is a defect in the development of bone and cartilage. Causes Achondrogenesis is inherited, which means it is passed down through families. Some types are known to be recessive, meaning both parents carry the defective gene but are not affected by this condition. The chance for a subsequent child to be affected is 25%. Symptoms Symptoms may include: Very short trunk, arms, legs, and neck Head appears large in relation to the trunk Small lower jaw Narrow chest Exams and Tests X-rays show bone problems associated with the condition. Treatment There is no current therapy. Talk to your health care provider about care decisions. You may want to seek genetic counseling. Outlook (Prognosis) The outcome is most often very poor. Many infants with achondrogenesis are stillborn or die shortly after birth because of breathing problems related to the abnormally small chest. Possible Complications This condition is often fatal early in life. When to Contact a Medical Professional This condition is often diagnosed on the first exam of an infant.

Adhesions are bands of scar-like tissue that form between two surfaces inside the body and cause them to stick together. Causes With movement of the body, internal organs such as the bowel or uterus are normally able to shift and to slide past each other. This is because these tissues and organs in the abdominal cavity have smooth, slippery surfaces. Inflammation (swelling), surgery, or injury can cause adhesions to form and prevent this movement. Adhesions can occur almost anywhere in the body, including: Joints, such as the shoulder Eyes Inside the abdomen or pelvis Adhesions can become larger or tighter over time. Problems may occur if the adhesions cause an organ or body part to: Twist Pull out of position Be unable to move normally The risk of forming adhesions is high after bowel or female organ surgeries. Surgery using a laparoscope is less likely to cause adhesions than open surgery. Other causes of adhesions in the abdomen or pelvis include: Appendicitis , most often when the appendix breaks open (ruptures) Cancer Endometriosis Infections in the abdomen and pelvis, such as appendicitis or fallopian tube infection Radiation treatment Adhesions around the joints may occur: After surgery or trauma With certain types of arthritis With overuse of a joint or tendon Symptoms Adhesions in joints, tendons, or ligaments make it harder to move the joint. They may also cause pain. Adhesions in the belly (abdomen) may cause a blockage of the intestines . Symptoms include: Bloating or swelling of your belly Constipation Nausea and vomiting No longer being able to pass gas Pain in the belly that is severe and crampy Adhesions in the pelvis may cause long-term (chronic) pelvic pain. Exams and Tests Most of the time, the adhesions cannot be seen using x-rays or imaging tests. Hysterosalpingography may help detect adhesions inside the uterus or fallopian tubes. X-rays of the abdomen, barium contrast studies, and CT scans may help detect a blockage of the intestines caused by adhesions. Endoscopy (a way of looking inside the body using a flexible tube that has a small camera on the end) may help diagnose adhesions: Hysteroscopy looks inside the uterus Laparoscopy looks inside the abdomen and pelvis Treatment Surgery may be done to separate the adhesions. This can let the organ regain normal movement and reduce symptoms. However, the risk for more adhesions goes up with more surgeries. Depending on the location of the adhesions, a barrier may be placed at the time of surgery to help reduce the chance of the adhesions returning. Outlook (Prognosis) The outcome is good in most cases. Possible Complications Adhesions can cause various disorders, depending on the tissues affected. In the eye, adhesion of the iris to the lens can lead to glaucoma . In the intestines, adhesions can cause partial or complete bowel obstruction . Adhesions inside the uterine cavity can cause a condition called Asherman syndrome . This can cause a woman to have irregular menstrual cycles and be unable to get pregnant. Pelvic adhesions that involve scarring of the fallopian tubes can lead to infertility and reproductive problems. Abdominal and pelvic adhesions can cause chronic pain.

Asthma is a chronic disease that causes the airways of the lungs to swell and narrow. It leads to breathing difficulty such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. Causes Asthma is caused by swelling (inflammation) in the airways. An asthma attack occurs when the lining of the air passages has become swollen and the muscles surrounding the airways become tight. This narrowing reduces the amount of air that can pass through the airway. Asthma symptoms can be caused by breathing in substances called allergens or triggers, or by other causes. Common asthma triggers include: Animals (pet hair or dander) Dust mites Certain medicines (aspirin and other NSAIDs) Changes in weather (most often cold weather) Chemicals in the air (pollution) or in food Physical activity Mold Pollen Respiratory infections, such as the common cold and many other viruses Strong emotions (stress) Tobacco or other inhalant that is smoked Substances in some workplaces can also trigger asthma symptoms, leading to occupational asthma . The most common triggers are wood dust, grain dust, animal dander, fungi, or chemicals. Many people with asthma have a personal or family history of allergies , such as hay fever ( allergic rhinitis ) or eczema . Others have no history of allergies. Symptoms Asthma symptoms vary from person to person. For example, you may have symptoms all the time or mostly during physical activity. Most people with asthma have attacks separated by symptom-free periods. Some people have long-term shortness of breath with episodes of increased shortness of breath. Wheezing or a cough may be the main symptom. Asthma attacks can last for minutes to days. An asthma attack may start suddenly or develop slowly over several hours or days. It may become dangerous if airflow is severely blocked. Symptoms of asthma include: Cough with or without sputum (phlegm) production Pulling in of the skin between the ribs when breathing ( intercostal retractions ) Shortness of breath that gets worse with exercise or activity Whistling sound or wheezing as you breathe Pain or tightness in the chest Difficulty sleeping Abnormal breathing pattern (breathing out takes more than twice as long as breathing in) Emergency symptoms that need prompt medical help include: Bluish color to the lips and face (cyanosis) Decreased level of alertness, such as severe drowsiness or confusion, during an asthma attack Extreme difficulty breathing Rapid pulse Severe anxiety due to shortness of breath Sweating Difficulty speaking Breathing temporarily stops Exams and Tests The health care provider will use a stethoscope to listen to your lungs. Wheezing or other asthma-related sounds may be heard. The provider will take your medical history and ask about your symptoms. Tests that may be ordered include: Allergy testing -- a skin test or a blood test to see if a person with asthma is allergic to certain substances Arterial blood gas -- often done in people who are having a severe asthma attack Chest x-ray or CT scan of the chest -- to check other conditions Lung function tests , including peak flow measurements Treatment The goals of treatment are to: Control airway swelling Limit exposure to substances that may trigger your symptoms Help you to be able to do normal activities without having asthma symptoms You and your provider should work as a team to manage your asthma symptoms. Follow your provider's instructions on taking medicines, eliminating asthma triggers, and monitoring symptoms. MEDICINES FOR ASTHMA There are two kinds of medicines for treating asthma: Control medicines to help prevent attacks Quick-relief (rescue) medicines for use during attacks LONG-TERM MEDICINES These are also called maintenance or control medicines. They are used to prevent symptoms in people with moderate to severe asthma. You must take these medicines every day for them to work. Take them even when you feel OK. Some long-term medicines are breathed in (inhaled), such as steroids and long-acting beta-agonists. Others are taken by mouth (orally). Your provider will prescribe the right medicine for you. QUICK-RELIEF MEDICINES These are also called rescue medicines. They are taken: For coughing, wheezing, trouble breathing, or during an asthma attack Just before physical activity to help prevent asthma symptoms Tell your provider if you are using quick-relief medicines twice a week or more. If so, your asthma may not be under control. Your provider may change the dose or your daily asthma control medicine to reduce the use of quick-relief medicines. Quick-relief medicines include: Short-acting inhaled bronchodilators Oral corticosteroids for a severe asthma attack A severe asthma attack requires a checkup by a provider. You may also need a hospital stay. There, you will likely be given oxygen, breathing assistance, and medicines given through a vein (IV). ASTHMA CARE AT HOME You can take steps to decrease the possibility of asthma attacks: Know the asthma symptoms to watch for . Know how to take your peak flow reading and what it means. Know which triggers make your asthma worse and what to do when it happens. Know how to care for your asthma before and during physical activity or exercise . Asthma action plans are written documents for managing asthma. An asthma action plan should include: Instructions for taking asthma medicines when your condition is stable A list of asthma triggers and how to avoid them How to recognize when your asthma is getting worse, what to do and when to call your provider A peak flow meter is a simple device to measure how quickly you can move air out of your lungs. It can help you see if an attack is coming, sometimes even before symptoms appear. Peak flow measurements help let you know when you need to take medicine or other action. Peak flow values of 50% to 80% of your best results are a sign of a moderate asthma attack. Numbers below 50% are a sign of a severe attack. Outlook (Prognosis) There is no cure for asthma, although symptoms sometimes improve over time. With proper self-care and medical treatment, most people with asthma can lead a normal life. Possible Complications The complications of asthma can be severe, and may include: Death Decreased ability to exercise and take part in other activities Lack of sleep due to nighttime symptoms Permanent changes in the function of the lungs Persistent cough Trouble breathing that requires breathing assistance (ventilator) When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider for an appointment if asthma symptoms develop. Contact your provider right away if: An asthma attack requires more medicine than recommended Symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment You have shortness of breath while talking Your peak flow measurement is 50% to 80% of your personal best Go to the emergency room right away if these symptoms occur: Drowsiness or confusion Severe shortness of breath at rest A peak flow measurement of less than 50% of your personal best Severe chest pain Bluish color to the lips and face (cyanosis) Extreme difficulty breathing Rapid pulse Severe anxiety due to shortness of breath Prevention You can reduce asthma symptoms by avoiding triggers and substances that irritate the airways. Cover bedding with allergy-proof casings to reduce exposure to dust mites. Remove carpets from bedrooms and vacuum regularly. Use only unscented detergents and cleaning materials in the home. Keep humidity levels low and fix leaks to reduce the growth of organisms such as mold. Keep the house clean and keep food in containers and out of bedrooms. This helps reduce the possibility of cockroaches. Body parts and droppings from cockroaches can trigger asthma attacks in some people. If someone is allergic to an animal that cannot be removed from the home, the animal should be kept out of the bedroom. Place filtering material over the heating/air conditioning outlets in your home to trap animal dander. Change the filter in furnaces and air conditioners often. Eliminate tobacco smoke from the home. This is the single most important thing a family can do to help someone with asthma. Smoking outside the house is not enough. Family members and visitors who smoke outside carry smoke residue inside on their clothes and hair. This can trigger asthma symptoms. If you smoke, now is a good time to quit. Avoid air pollution, industrial dust, and irritating fumes as much as possible.

An arrhythmia is a disorder of the heart rate (pulse) or heart rhythm. The heart can beat too fast (tachycardia), too slow (bradycardia), or irregularly. An arrhythmia can be harmless, a sign of other heart problems, or an immediate danger to your health. Causes Normally, your heart works as a pump that brings blood to the lungs and the rest of the body. To help this happen, your heart has an electrical system that makes sure it contracts (squeezes) in an orderly way. The electrical impulse that signals your heart to contract begins in an area of the heart called the sinoatrial node (also called the sinus node or SA node). This is your heart's natural pacemaker. The signal leaves the SA node and travels through the heart along a set electrical pathway. Different nerve messages signal your heart to beat slower or faster. Arrhythmias are caused by problems with the heart's electrical conduction system. Abnormal extra signals may occur. Electrical signals may be blocked or slowed. Electrical signals travel in new or different pathways through the heart. Some common causes of abnormal heartbeats are: Abnormal levels of potassium, magnesium, or other substances in the body Heart attack, or a damaged heart muscle from a past heart attack Heart disease that is present at birth (congenital) Heart failure or an enlarged heart Overactive thyroid gland Watch this video about: Arrhythmias Arrhythmias may also be caused by some substances or drugs, including: Alcohol or stimulant drugs Certain medicines Cigarette smoking (nicotine) Some of the more common abnormal heart rhythms are: Atrial fibrillation or flutter Atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) Heart block or atrioventricular block Multifocal atrial tachycardia Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia Sick sinus syndrome Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Symptoms When you have an arrhythmia, your heartbeat may be: Too slow (bradycardia) Too quick (tachycardia) Irregular, uneven, possibly with extra or skipped beats An arrhythmia may be present all of the time or it may come and go. You may or may not feel symptoms when the arrhythmia is present. Or, you may only notice symptoms when you are more active. Symptoms can be very mild, or they may be severe or even life threatening. Common symptoms that may occur when the arrhythmia is present could include: Chest pain Fainting Lightheadedness , dizziness Paleness Palpitations (feeling your heart beat fast or irregularly) Shortness of breath Sweating Exams and Tests The health care provider will listen to your heart with a stethoscope and feel your pulse. Your blood pressure may be low or normal or even high as a result of being uncomfortable. An electrocardiogram ( ECG ) will be the first test done. Heart monitoring devices are often used to identify the rhythm problem, such as a: Holter monitor (where you wear a device that records and stores your heart rhythm for 24 or more hours) Event monitor or loop recorder (worn for 2 weeks or longer, where you record your heart rhythm when you feel an abnormal rhythm) Other long-term monitoring options An echocardiogram is sometimes ordered to examine the size or structure of your heart. In selected cases, coronary angiography may be performed to see how blood flows through the arteries in your heart. A special test, called an electrophysiology study (EPS), is sometimes done to take a closer look at the heart's electrical system. Treatment When an arrhythmia is serious, you may need urgent treatment to restore a normal rhythm. This may include: Electrical therapy (defibrillation or cardioversion) Implanting a short-term heart pacemaker Medicines given through a vein or by mouth Sometimes, better treatment for your angina or heart failure will lower your chance of having an arrhythmia. Medicines called anti-arrhythmic drugs may be used: To prevent an arrhythmia from happening again To keep your heart rate from becoming too fast or too slow Some of these medicines can have side effects. Take them as prescribed by your provider. Do not stop taking the medicine or change the dose without first talking to your provider. Other treatments to prevent or treat abnormal heart rhythms include: Cardiac ablation , used to target areas in your heart that may be causing your heart rhythm problems An implantable cardioverter defibrillator , placed in people who are at high risk of sudden cardiac death Permanent pacemaker , a device that senses when your heart is beating too slowly. It sends a signal to your heart that makes your heart beat at the correct pace. Outlook (Prognosis) The outcome depends on several factors: The kind of arrhythmia you have. Whether you have coronary artery disease , heart failure , or valvular heart disease. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if: You develop any of the symptoms of a possible arrhythmia. You have been diagnosed with an arrhythmia and your symptoms worsen or do not improve with treatment. Prevention Taking steps to prevent coronary artery disease may reduce your chance of developing an arrhythmia.

If your child is under age 2 years, check with your health care provider before giving your child acetaminophen. To give the correct dose, you will need to know your child's weight. You also need to know how much acetaminophen is in the product you are using. You can read the label to find out. For chewable tablets, the label will tell you how many milligrams (mg) are found in each tablet, such as 160 mg per tablet. For liquids , the label will tell you how many mgs are found in 5 mL, such as 160 mg/5 mL. For syrups, you will need some type of dosing syringe. It may come with the medicine, or you can ask your pharmacist. Make sure to clean it out after each use.

Acute mountain sickness is an illness that can affect mountain climbers, hikers, skiers, or travelers at high altitudes, usually above 8000 feet (2400 meters). Causes Acute mountain sickness is caused by reduced air pressure and lower oxygen levels at high altitudes. The faster you climb to a high altitude, the more likely you will get acute mountain sickness. The best way to prevent altitude illness is to ascend gradually. It is a good idea to spend a few days ascending to 9850 feet (3000 meters). Above this point ascend very slowly so that the elevation at which you sleep does not increase more than 990 feet to 1640 feet (300m to 500m) per night. You are at higher risk for acute mountain sickness if: You live at or near sea level and travel to a high altitude. You have had the illness before. You ascend quickly. You have not acclimatized appropriately to the altitude. Alcohol or other substances have interfered with acclimatization. You have medical problems involving the heart, nervous system, or lungs. If you have anemia Symptoms Your symptoms will also depend on the speed of your climb and how hard you push (exert) yourself. Symptoms range from mild to life-threatening. They can affect the nervous system, lungs, muscles, and heart. In most cases, symptoms are mild. Symptoms of mild to moderate acute mountain sickness may include: Difficulty sleeping Dizziness or lightheadedness Fatigue Headache Loss of appetite Nausea or vomiting Rapid pulse (heart rate) Shortness of breath with exertion Symptoms that may occur with more severe acute mountain sickness include the following and may progress to high altitude pulmonary edema or high altitude cerebral edema: Blue color to the skin (cyanosis) Chest tightness or congestion Confusion Cough Coughing up blood Decreased consciousness or withdrawal from social interaction Gray or pale complexion Inability to walk in a straight line, or walk at all Shortness of breath at rest Exams and Tests The health care provider will examine you and listen to your chest with a stethoscope. This may reveal sounds called crackles (rales) in the lung. Rales may be a sign of fluid in the lungs. Tests that may be done include: Blood tests Brain CT scan Chest x-ray Electrocardiogram (ECG) Treatment Early diagnosis is important. Acute mountain sickness is easier to treat in the early stages. The main treatment for all forms of mountain sickness is to climb down (descend) to a lower altitude as rapidly and safely as possible. You should not continue climbing up if you develop symptoms. Extra oxygen should be given, if available. People with severe mountain sickness may need to be admitted to a hospital. A medicine called acetazolamide (Diamox) may be given to help you breathe better. It can help reduce symptoms. This medicine can make you urinate more often. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids and avoid alcohol when taking this medicine. This medicine works best when taken before reaching a high altitude. If you have fluid in your lungs (pulmonary edema), treatment may include: Oxygen A high blood pressure medicine called nifedipine Beta agonist inhalers to open the airways Breathing machine in severe cases Medicine to increase blood flow to the lungs called phosphodiesterase inhibitor (such as sildenafil) Dexamethasone (Decadron) may help reduce acute mountain sickness symptoms and swelling in the brain (cerebral edema). Portable hyperbaric chambers allow hikers to simulate conditions at lower altitudes without actually moving from their location on the mountain. These devices are very helpful if bad weather or other factors make climbing down the mountain impossible. Outlook (Prognosis) Most cases are mild. Symptoms improve quickly when you climb down the mountain to a lower altitude. Severe cases may result in death due to lung problems (pulmonary edema) or brain swelling (cerebral edema). In remote locations, emergency evacuation may not be possible, or treatment may be delayed. This can have a negative effect on the outcome. The outlook depends on how quickly the affected person can get to a lower altitude once symptoms begin. Some people are more prone to developing altitude-related sickness and may not respond as well as others. Possible Complications Complications may include: Coma (unresponsiveness) Fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) Swelling of the brain (cerebral edema), which can lead to seizures, mental changes, or permanent damage to the nervous system Death When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have or had symptoms of acute mountain sickness, even if you felt better when you returned to a lower altitude. Call 911 or the local emergency number if you or another climber have any of the following symptoms: Altered level of alertness Coughing up blood Severe breathing problems Climb down the mountain right away and as safely as possible. Prevention Keys to preventing acute mountain sickness include: Climb the mountain gradually. Gradual ascent is the most important factor in preventing acute mountain sickness. Stop for a day or two of rest for every 2000 feet (600 meters) of climb above 8000 feet (2400 meters). Sleep at a lower altitude when possible. Make sure that you have the ability to rapidly descend if needed. Learn how to recognize early symptoms of mountain sickness. If you are traveling above 9840 feet (3000 meters), you should carry enough oxygen for several days. If you plan on climbing quickly, or climbing to a high altitude, ask your provider about medicines that may help prevent acute mountain sickness, such as acetazolamide or dexamethasone. If you are at risk for a low red blood cell count (anemia), ask your provider if your planned trip is safe. Also ask if an iron supplement is right for you. Anemia lowers the amount of oxygen in your blood. This makes you more likely to have mountain sickness. While climbing: Do not drink alcohol Drink plenty of fluids Eat regular meals that are high in carbohydrates You should avoid high altitudes if you have heart or lung disease.

Your child has asthma , which causes the airways of the lungs to swell and narrow. Now that your child is going home from the hospital, follow your health care provider's instructions on how to care for your child. Use the information below as a reminder. When You're in the Hospital In the hospital, your provider helped your child breathe better. This likely involved giving oxygen through a mask and medicines to open the lung airways. What to Expect at Home Your child will probably still have asthma symptoms after leaving the hospital. These symptoms include: Wheezing and coughing that may last up to 5 days Sleeping and eating that may take up to a week to return to normal You may need to take time off work to care for your child. Take Charge of Your Child's Asthma at Home Make sure you know the asthma symptoms to watch out for in your child. You should know how to take your child's peak flow reading and understand what it means. Know your child's personal best peak flow reading. Know your child's peak flow reading that tells you if their asthma is getting worse. Know your child's peak flow reading that means you need to contact your child's provider. Keep the phone number (or other contact information) of your child's provider with you. Triggers may make asthma symptoms worse. Know which triggers make your child's asthma worse and what to do when this happens. Common triggers include: Pets Smells from chemicals and cleaners Grass and weeds Smoke Dust Cockroaches Rooms that are moldy or damp Know how to prevent or treat asthma symptoms that arise when your child is active. These things might also trigger your child's asthma: Cold or dry air. Smoky or polluted air. Grass that has just been mowed. Starting and stopping an activity too fast. Try to make sure your child warms up before being very active and cools down after. Understand your child's asthma medicines and how they should be taken. These include: Asthma control medicines that your child takes every day Quick-relief asthma medicines when your child has symptoms Keep Smoking Away From Your Child No one should smoke in your house. This includes you, your visitors, your child's babysitters, and anyone else who comes to your house. Smokers should smoke outside and wear a coat. The coat will keep smoke particles from sticking to clothes, so it should be left outside or away from the child. Ask people who work at your child's day care, preschool, school, and anyone else who takes care of your child, if they smoke. If they do, make sure they smoke away from your child. School and Asthma Children with asthma may need a lot of support at school . They may need help from school staff to keep their asthma under control and to be able to do school activities. There should be an asthma action plan at school. The people who should have a copy of the plan is based on the school's policy, but may include: Your child's teacher The school nurse The school office Gym teachers and coaches Your child should be able to take asthma medicines at school when needed. School staff should know your child's asthma triggers. Your child should be able to go to another location to get away from asthma triggers, if needed. When to Call the Doctor Contact your child's provider if your child is having any of the following: Hard time breathing Chest muscles are pulling in with each breath Breathing faster than 50 to 60 breaths per minute (when not crying) Making a grunting noise Sitting with shoulders hunched over Skin, nails, gums, lips, or area around the eyes is bluish or grayish Extremely tired Not moving around very much Limp or floppy body Nostrils are flaring out when breathing Also contact your provider if your child: Loses their appetite Is irritable Has trouble sleeping Alternative Names Pediatric asthma - discharge; Wheezing - discharge; Reactive airway disease - discharge Images Asthma control drugs References Jackson DJ, Lemanske RF, Bacharier LB.

Allergy skin tests are used to find out which substances cause a person to have an allergic reaction . These substances are called allergens. How the Test is Performed There are three common methods of allergy skin testing. The skin prick test involves: Placing a small amount of substances (allergens) that may be causing your symptoms on the skin, most often on the forearm, upper arm, or back. The skin is then pricked so the allergen goes under the skin's surface. The health care provider closely watches the skin for swelling and redness or other signs of a reaction. Results are usually seen within 15 to 20 minutes. Several allergens can be tested at the same time. The intradermal skin test involves: Injecting a small amount of allergen into the skin. The provider then watches for a reaction at the site. This test is more likely to be used to find out if you're allergic to bee venom or penicillin. Or it may be used if the skin prick test was negative and the provider still thinks that you're allergic to the allergen. Patch testing is a method to diagnose the cause of skin reactions that occur after the substance touches the skin: Possible allergens are taped to the skin for 48 hours. The provider will look at the area in 72 to 96 hours. How to Prepare for the Test Before any allergy testing, the provider will ask about: Illnesses Where you live and work Lifestyle Foods and eating habits Allergy medicines can change the results of skin tests. Your provider will tell you which medicines to avoid and when to stop taking them before the test. How the Test will Feel Skin tests may cause very mild discomfort when the skin is pricked. You may have symptoms such as itching, a stuffy nose, red watery eyes, or a skin rash if you're allergic to the substance in the test. In rare cases, people can have a whole-body allergic reaction (called anaphylaxis ), which can be life threatening. This usually only occurs with intradermal testing. Your provider will be prepared to treat this serious response. Patch tests may be irritating or itchy. These symptoms will go away when the patch tests are removed. Why the Test is Performed Allergy tests are done to find out which substances are causing your allergy symptoms. Your provider may order allergy skin tests if you have: Hay fever ( allergic rhinitis ) and asthma symptoms that are not well controlled with medicine Hives and angioedema Food allergies Skin rashes ( dermatitis ), in which the skin becomes red, sore, or swollen after contact with the substance Penicillin allergy Venom allergy Allergies to penicillin and related medicines are the only drug allergies that can be tested using skin tests. Skin tests for allergies to other drugs can be dangerous. The skin prick test may also be used to diagnose food allergies. Intradermal tests are not used to test for food allergies because of high false-positive results and the danger of causing a severe allergic reaction. Normal Results A negative test result means there were no skin changes in response to the allergen. This negative reaction most often means that you are not allergic to the substance. In rare cases, a person may have a negative allergy test and still be allergic to the substance. What Abnormal Results Mean A positive result means you reacted to a substance. Your provider will see a red, raised area called a wheal. Often, a positive result means the symptoms you're having are due to exposure to that substance. A stronger response means you are likely more sensitive to the substance. People can have a positive response to a substance with allergy skin testing, but not have any problems with that substance in everyday life. Skin tests are usually accurate. But, if the dose of allergen is large, even people who are not allergic will have a positive reaction. Your provider will consider your symptoms and the results of your skin test to suggest lifestyle changes you can make to avoid substances that may be causing your symptoms.

Atrial fibrillation (Afib) and atrial flutter are common types of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) which affect the upper chambers (atria) of the heart. In atrial flutter, the heart beats too fast, but mostly continues to contract in a regular rhythm. AFib is a closely related condition in which the atria contract in a chaotic manner, or "quivers." This creates an irregular heart rhythm that is also usually too fast. Afib and atrial flutter often occur in the same person at different times. Causes When working well, the 4 chambers of the heart contract (squeeze) in an organized way. Electrical signals direct your heart to pump the right amount of blood for your body's needs. The signals begin in an area called the sinoatrial node (also called the sinus node or SA node). In people with AFib, the electrical impulse of the heart is not regular. This is because the sinoatrial node no longer controls the sequence of heart muscle contractions (rhythm) in the upper chambers of the heart (atria). In AFib: The atria do not contract in an organized pattern. The lower chambers of the heart (ventricles) contract in an irregular manner that is often too fast. As a result, the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. In people with atrial flutter, the atria beat very rapidly, but in a regular pattern. These problems can affect both men and women. They become more common with increasing age. Common causes of AFib include: Alcohol use (especially binge drinking) Coronary artery disease Heart attack or heart bypass surgery Heart failure or an enlarged heart Heart valve disease (most often the mitral valve) Hypertension Medicines Overactive thyroid gland ( hyperthyroidism ) Pericarditis Sick sinus syndrome Symptoms You may not be aware that your heart is not beating in a normal pattern. When symptoms are present, they may include one or more of the following: Pulse that feels rapid, racing, pounding or thumping, fluttering, irregular, or too slow. Sensation of feeling the heart beat ( palpitations ). Confusion . Dizziness , lightheadedness. Fainting . Fatigue . Weakness. Loss of ability to exercise. Shortness of breath and anxiety. Sweating. Chest pain or pressure , which may be a sign of a heart attack. Call 911 or the local emergency number right away if you have chest pain or pressure. Exams and Tests Your health care provider may hear a fast heartbeat while listening to your heart with a stethoscope. Your pulse may feel fast, uneven, or both. The normal heart rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute. In Afib or flutter, the heart rate may be as high as 250 to 350 beats per minute and is very often over 100 beats per minute. Blood pressure may be normal or low. An ECG (a test that records the electrical activity of the heart) may show AFib or atrial flutter. If your abnormal heart rhythm comes and goes, you may need to wear a special monitor to diagnose the problem. The monitor records the heart's rhythms over a period of time. Event monitor (3 to 4 weeks) Holter monitor (24-hour test) Implanted loop recorder (extended monitoring) Tests to find heart disease may include: Echocardiogram (ultrasound imaging of the heart) Tests to examine the blood supply of the heart muscle Tests to study the heart's electrical system Treatment Cardioversion treatment may be used to get the heart back into a normal rhythm right away. There are two options for treatment: Electric shocks to your heart Medicines given through a vein These treatments may be done as emergency methods, or planned ahead of time. Daily medicines taken by mouth are used to: Slow the irregular heartbeat and maintain normal heart rhythm -- These drugs may include beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, and anti-arrhythmics. Prevent blood clots -- Blood-thinning medicines are often given to reduce the risk of blood clots that can result from ongoing irregular heart rhythms. Prevent AFib from coming back -- These drugs work well in many people, but they can have serious side effects. AFib returns in many people, even while they are taking these medicines. A procedure called radiofrequency ablation can be used to scar areas in your heart where the heart rhythm problems are triggered. This can prevent the abnormal electrical signals that cause AFib or flutter from moving through your heart. You may need a heart pacemaker after this procedure. All people with AFib will need to learn how to manage this condition at home . People with AFib will most often need to take blood thinner medicines. These medicines are used to reduce the risk of developing a blood clot that travels in the body (and that can cause a stroke, for example). The irregular heart rhythm that occurs with AFib makes blood clots more likely to form. Blood thinner medicines include heparin , warfarin (Coumadin), apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), edoxaban (Savaysa) and dabigatran (Pradaxa). Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin or clopidogrel may also be prescribed. However, blood thinners increase the chance of bleeding, so not everyone can use them. Another stroke prevention option for people who cannot safely take these medicines is the Watchman Device, which has recently been approved by the FDA. This is a small basket-shaped implant that is placed inside the heart to block off the area of the heart where most of the clots form. This limits clots from forming. Your provider will consider your age and other medical problems when deciding which stroke prevention methods are best for you. Outlook (Prognosis) Treatment can often control this disorder. Many people with AFib do very well with treatment. AFib tends to return and get worse. It may come back in some people, even with treatment. Clots that break off and travel to the brain can cause a stroke . When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have symptoms of AFib or flutter. Prevention Talk to your provider about steps to treat conditions that cause atrial fibrillation and flutter. Avoid binge drinking.

The blood vessels that bring blood to your brain and face are called the carotid arteries. You have a carotid artery on each side of your neck. The blood flow in this artery can become partly or totally blocked by fatty material called plaque. A partial blockage is called carotid artery stenosis (narrowing). A blockage in your carotid artery can reduce the blood supply to your brain. Sometimes part of a plaque can break off, travel downstream and block a brain artery. A stroke can occur if your brain does not get enough blood. Two procedures can be used to treat a carotid artery that is narrowed or blocked. These are: Surgery to remove plaque buildup ( endarterectomy ) Carotid artery angioplasty with stent placement Description Carotid artery angioplasty and stenting (CAS) is done using a small surgical cut. Your surgeon will make a surgical cut in your groin after using some numbing medicine. You will also be given medicine to relax you. The surgeon places a catheter (a flexible tube) through the cut into an artery. It is carefully moved up to your neck to the blockage in your carotid artery. Moving x-ray pictures (fluoroscopy) are used to see the artery and guide the catheter to the correct position. Next, the surgeon will move a wire through the catheter to the blockage. Another catheter with a very small balloon on the end will be pushed over this wire and into the blockage. Then the balloon is inflated. The balloon presses against the inside wall of your artery. This opens the artery and allows more blood to flow to your brain. A stent (a wire mesh tube) may also be placed in the blocked area. The stent is inserted at the same time as the balloon catheter. It expands with the balloon. The stent is left in place to help keep the artery open. The surgeon then removes the balloon and catheters. Why the Procedure is Performed Carotid artery surgery (endarterectomy) is a well-established and effective way to treat narrowed or blocked arteries. This procedure is very safe. CAS has developed as a good alternative to surgery in some cases, when done by experienced surgeons. Certain factors may favor stenting, such as: The person is too ill to have carotid endarterectomy. The location of the narrowing in the carotid artery makes surgery harder. The person has had neck or carotid surgery in the past. The person has had radiation to the neck. Risks Risks of CAS, which depend on factors such as age, are: Allergic reaction to dye Blood clots or bleeding at the site of surgery Brain damage Clogging of the inside of the stent (in-stent restenosis) Heart attack Kidney failure (higher risk in people who already have kidney problems) More blockage of the carotid artery over time Seizures (this is rare) Stroke Before the Procedure Your health care provider will do a physical exam and perform several medical tests. Always tell your provider what medicines you are taking, including drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription. During the 2 weeks before your procedure: Days before the surgery, you may have to stop taking blood thinner such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), clopidogrel (Plavix), ticagrelor (Brilinta), prasugrel (Effient), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and other medicines like these. Ask your provider which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery. If you smoke, you need to stop. Ask your provider for help quitting. Always let your provider know about any cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness you may have before your surgery. DO NOT drink anything after midnight the night before your surgery, including water. On the day of your surgery: Take the medicines you have been told to take with a small sip of water. You will be told when to arrive at the hospital. After the Procedure After surgery, you may need to stay in the hospital overnight so that you can be watched for any signs of bleeding, stroke, or poor blood flow to your brain. You may be able to go home the same day if your procedure is done early in the day and you are doing well. Your provider will talk to you about how to care for yourself at home. Outlook (Prognosis) Carotid artery angioplasty and stenting may help lower your chance of having a stroke. But you may need to make lifestyle changes, such as change in diet and regular exercise, to help prevent plaque buildup, blood clots, and other problems in your carotid arteries over time. In addition, your provider will recommend medicines to further reduce your chance of a stroke.

Acidosis is a condition in which there is too much acid in the body fluids. It is the opposite of alkalosis (a condition in which there is too much base in the body fluids). Causes The kidneys and lungs maintain the balance (proper pH level) of chemicals called acids and bases in the body. Acidosis occurs when acid builds up or when bicarbonate (a base) is lost. Acidosis is classified as either respiratory or metabolic acidosis . Respiratory acidosis develops when there is too much carbon dioxide (an acid) in the body. This type of acidosis is usually caused when the body is unable to remove enough carbon dioxide through breathing. Other names for respiratory acidosis are hypercapnic acidosis and carbon dioxide acidosis. Causes of respiratory acidosis include: Chest deformities, such as kyphosis Chest injuries Chest muscle weakness Long-term (chronic) lung disease Neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or muscular dystrophy Overuse of sedative drugs, causing decreased respiration Acute lung disease, such as severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with severe medical illness Metabolic acidosis develops when too much acid is produced in the body. It can also occur when the kidneys cannot remove enough acid from the body. There are several types of metabolic acidosis: Diabetic acidosis (also called diabetic ketoacidosis and DKA) develops when substances called ketone bodies (which are acidic) build up during uncontrolled diabetes (usually type 1 diabetes). Hyperchloremic acidosis is caused by the loss of too much sodium bicarbonate from the body, which can happen with severe diarrhea. Kidney disease (uremia, distal renal tubular acidosis or proximal renal tubular acidosis ). Lactic acidosis. Poisoning by aspirin, ethylene glycol (found in antifreeze), or methanol. Severe dehydration . Lactic acidosis is a buildup of lactic acid . Lactic acid is mainly produced in muscle cells and red blood cells. It forms when the body breaks down carbohydrates to use for energy when oxygen levels are low. This can be caused by: Cancer Carbon monoxide poisoning Drinking too much alcohol Exercising vigorously for a very long time Liver failure Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) Medicines, such as salicylates, metformin, anti-retrovirals MELAS (a very rare genetic mitochondrial disorder that affects energy production) Prolonged lack of oxygen from shock, heart failure, or severe anemia Seizures Sepsis -- severe illness due to infection with bacteria or other germs Severe asthma Compensated acidosis occurs when the body returns the acid-base balance to near normal in cases of acidosis, but bicarbonate and carbon dioxide levels remain abnormal. Symptoms Metabolic acidosis symptoms depend on the underlying disease or condition. Metabolic acidosis itself causes rapid and deep breathing as your body tries to compensate for it. Confusion or lethargy may also occur. Severe metabolic acidosis can lead to shock or death. In some situations, metabolic acidosis can be a mild, ongoing (chronic) condition. Respiratory acidosis symptoms can include: Confusion Fatigue Lethargy Shortness of breath Sleepiness Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about your symptoms. These tests can help diagnose acidosis. They can also determine whether the cause is a breathing problem or a metabolic problem. Tests may include: Arterial or venous blood gas analysis Basic metabolic panel (group of blood tests that measure sodium and potassium levels, kidney function, and other chemicals and functions) to show whether the type of acidosis is metabolic or respiratory Blood ketones Lactic acid test Urine ketones Urine pH Other blood tests may be needed to determine the cause of the acidosis. Other tests that may be needed to determine the cause of the acidosis include: Chest x-ray CT abdomen Urinalysis Urine pH Treatment Treatment is aimed at the health problem causing the acidosis. In some cases, sodium bicarbonate (the chemical in baking soda) may be given to reduce the acidity of the blood. Often, you will receive lots of fluids through your vein. Outlook (Prognosis) Acidosis can be dangerous if untreated. Many cases respond well to treatment. The outlook will depend on the underlying disease causing the condition. Possible Complications Complications depend on the specific type of acidosis. When to Contact a Medical Professional All the types of acidosis will cause symptoms that require treatment by your provider. Prevention Prevention depends on the cause of the acidosis. Many causes of metabolic acidosis can be prevented, including diabetic ketoacidosis and some causes of lactic acidosis. Normally, people with healthy kidneys and lungs do not have serious acidosis.

Blood flows out of your heart and into a large blood vessel called the aorta. The aortic valve separates the heart and aorta. The aortic valve opens so blood can flow out. It then closes to keep blood from returning to the heart. You may need aortic valve surgery to replace the aortic valve in your heart if: Your aortic valve does not close all the way, so blood leaks back into the heart. This is called aortic regurgitation. Your aortic valve does not open fully, so blood flow out of the heart is reduced. This is called aortic stenosis. Open aortic valve surgery replaces the valve through a large cut in your chest. The aortic valve can also be replaced using minimally invasive aortic valve surgery. This is done using several small cuts. Description Before your surgery you will receive general anesthesia . You will be asleep and pain free. Your surgeon will make a 10-inch-long (25 centimeters) cut in the middle of your chest. Next, your surgeon will divide your breastbone to be able to see your heart and aorta. You may need to be connected to a heart-lung bypass machine or bypass pump. Your heart is stopped while you are connected to this machine. This machine does the work of your heart while your heart is stopped. If your aortic valve is too damaged, you will need a new valve. This is called valve replacement surgery. Your surgeon will remove your aortic valve and sew a new one into place. There are two main types of new valves: Mechanical, made of man-made materials, such as titanium or carbon. These valves last the longest. You may need to take blood-thinning medicine, such as warfarin (Coumadin) for the rest of your life if you have this type of valve. Biological, made of human or animal tissue. These valves may last 10 to 20 years, but you may not need to take blood thinners for life. Once the new valve is working, your surgeon will: Close your heart and take you off the heart-lung machine. Place catheters (tubes) around your heart to drain fluids that build up. Close your breastbone with stainless steel wires. It will take about 6 to 12 weeks for the bone to heal. The wires will stay inside your body. This surgery may take 3 to 5 hours. Sometimes other procedures are done during open aortic surgery. These include: Coronary bypass surgery Aortic root replacement (David procedure) Ross (or switch) procedure Why the Procedure is Performed You may need surgery if your aortic valve does not work properly. You may need open-heart valve surgery for these reasons: Changes in your aortic valve are causing major heart symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting spells, or heart failure. Tests show that changes in your aortic valve are beginning to seriously harm how well your heart works. Your heart valve has been damaged by infection of the heart valve ( endocarditis ). You have received a new heart valve in the past and it is not working well. You have other problems such as blood clots , infection, or bleeding . Risks Risks for any surgery are: Blood clots in the legs that may travel to the lungs Blood loss Breathing problems Infection, including in the lungs, kidneys, bladder, chest, or heart valves Reactions to medicines Possible risks from having open heart surgery are: Heart attack or stroke Heart rhythm problems Incision infection, which is more likely to occur in people who are obese, have diabetes, or have already had this surgery Infection of the new valve Kidney failure Memory loss and loss of mental clarity, or "fuzzy thinking" Poor healing of the incision Post-pericardiotomy syndrome (low-grade fever and chest pain) that could last up to 6 months Death Before the Procedure Always tell your health care provider: If you are or could be pregnant What medicines you are taking, even drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription You may be able to store blood in the blood bank for transfusions during and after your surgery. Ask your provider how you and your family members can donate blood. If you smoke, you must stop. Ask your provider for help. For the 1 week period before surgery, you may be asked to stop taking medicines that make it harder for your blood to clot. These might cause increased bleeding during the surgery. Some of these drugs are aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). If you are taking warfarin (Coumadin), clopidogrel (Plavix), or other blood thinning medicines, talk with your surgeon before stopping or changing how you take these drugs. During the days before your surgery: Ask which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery. Always let your provider know if you have a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or any other illness in the time leading up to your surgery. Prepare your house for when you get home from the hospital. Shower and wash your hair the day before your surgery. You may need to wash your whole body below your neck with a special soap. Scrub your chest 2 or 3 times with this soap. On the day of your surgery: You will most often be asked not to drink or eat anything after midnight the night before your surgery. This includes using chewing gum and breath mints. Rinse your mouth with water if it feels dry. Be careful not to swallow. Take the medicines you have been told to take with a small sip of water. You will be told when to arrive at the hospital. After the Procedure Expect to spend 4 to 7 days in the hospital after surgery. You will spend the first night in the ICU and may stay there for 1 to 2 days. There will be 2 to 3 tubes in your chest to drain fluid from around your heart. These are usually removed 1 to 3 days after surgery. You may have a catheter (flexible tube) in your bladder to drain urine. You may also have intravenous (IV) lines to deliver fluids. Nurses will closely watch monitors that display your vital signs (your pulse, temperature, and breathing). You will be moved to a regular hospital room from the ICU. Your heart and vital signs will continue to be monitored until you go home. You will receive pain medicine to control pain around your surgical cut. Your nurse will help you slowly resume some activity. You may begin a program to make your heart and body stronger. You may have a pacemaker placed in your heart if your heart rate becomes too slow after surgery. It may be temporary or permanent. Outlook (Prognosis) Mechanical heart valves do not fail often. However, blood clots can develop on them. If a blood clot forms, you may have a stroke. Bleeding can occur, but this is rare. Biological valves have a lower risk of blood clots, but tend to fail over an extended period of time. For best results, choose to have your aortic valve surgery at a center that does many of these procedures.

Acute adrenal crisis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when there is not enough cortisol. This is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands . Causes The adrenal glands are small hormone-releasing organs located on top of each kidney. They are made up of an outer portion called the cortex, and an inner portion called the medulla. The cortex produces 3 hormones: Glucocorticoid hormones (such as cortisol) maintain sugar (glucose) control, blood pressure, decrease (suppress) immune response, and help the body respond to stress. Mineralocorticoid hormones (such as aldosterone) regulate sodium, water and potassium balance. Sex hormones, androgens (male) and estrogens (female), affect sexual development and sex drive. The medulla produces the hormone adrenaline (also called epinephrine). Both cortisol and adrenaline are released in response to stress . Cortisol production is regulated by the pituitary. This is a small gland just underneath the brain. The pituitary releases adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). This is a hormone that causes the adrenal glands to release cortisol. Adrenaline production is regulated by nerves coming from the brain and spinal cord and by circulating hormones. Adrenal crisis can occur from any of the following: The adrenal gland is damaged due to, for example, Addison disease or other adrenal gland disease, or surgery The pituitary is injured and cannot release ACTH ( hypopituitarism ) Adrenal insufficiency is not properly treated You've been taking glucocorticoid medicines for a long time, and suddenly stop You've become very dehydrated Infection or other physical stress Symptoms Symptoms and signs of adrenal crisis can include any of the following: Abdominal pain or flank pain Confusion , loss of consciousness, or coma Dehydration Dizziness or lightheadedness Fatigue, severe weakness Headache High fever Loss of appetite Low blood pressure Low blood sugar Nausea, vomiting Rapid heart rate Rapid respiratory rate Slow, sluggish movement Unusual and excessive sweating on face or palms Exams and Tests Tests that may be ordered to help diagnose acute adrenal crisis include: ACTH (cosyntropin) stimulation test Cortisol level Blood sugar Potassium level Sodium level Blood pH level Thyroid hormone level Treatment Adrenal crisis is a medical emergency. In adrenal crisis, you need to be given the medicine hydrocortisone right away through a vein ( intravenous ) or muscle (intramuscular). You may receive intravenous fluids if you have low blood pressure. You will need to go to the hospital for treatment and monitoring. If infection or another medical problem caused the crisis, you may need additional treatment. Many people with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency have an emergency syringe with hydrocortisone at home that a family member can inject into muscle if they are too sick or too weak to take their hydrocortisone pills. Outlook (Prognosis) Shock may occur if treatment is not provided early, and it can be life threatening from very low blood pressure and heart problems. When to Contact a Medical Professional Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you develop symptoms of acute adrenal crisis. Contact your health care provider if you have Addison disease or hypopituitarism and are unable to take your glucocorticoid medicine for any reason. If you have Addison disease, you will usually be told to temporarily increase the dosage of your glucocorticoid medicine if you are stressed or ill, or before having surgery. This is called 'stress' or 'sick-day' dosing. Prevention If you have Addison disease, learn to recognize the signs of potential stress that may cause an acute adrenal crisis. If you have been instructed by your provider, be prepared to give yourself an emergency shot of glucocorticoid or to increase your dosage of oral glucocorticoid medicine in times of stress. Parents should learn to do this for their children who have adrenal insufficiency. Always carry medical ID (card, bracelet, or necklace) that says you have adrenal insufficiency. The ID should also say the type of medicine and dosage you need in case of an emergency. If you take glucocorticoid medicines for pituitary ACTH deficiency, be sure you know when to take a stress dose of your medicine. Discuss this with your provider. Never miss taking your medicines.

Acoustic trauma is injury to the hearing mechanisms in the inner ear. It is due to very loud noise. Causes Acoustic trauma is a common cause of sensory hearing loss . Damage to the hearing mechanisms within the inner ear may be caused by: Explosion near the ear Firing a gun near the ear Long-term exposure to loud noises (such as loud music or machinery) Any very loud noise near the ear Symptoms Symptoms include: Partial hearing loss that most often involves repeated long-term exposures to loud or high-pitched sounds. The hearing loss may slowly get worse. Noises, ringing in the ear ( tinnitus ). Exams and Tests The health care provider will most often suspect acoustic trauma if hearing loss occurs after noise exposure. A physical exam will determine if the eardrum is damaged. Audiometry may determine how much hearing has been lost. Treatment The hearing loss may not be treatable. The goal of treatment is to protect the ear from further damage. Eardrum repair may be needed. A hearing aid may help you communicate. You can also learn coping skills, such as lip reading. In some cases, your provider may prescribe steroid medicine to help bring back some of the hearing. Outlook (Prognosis) Hearing loss may be permanent in the affected ear. Wearing ear protection when around sources of loud sounds may prevent the hearing loss from getting worse. Possible Complications Progressive hearing loss is the main complication of acoustic trauma. Tinnitus (ear ringing) can also occur. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if: You have symptoms of acoustic trauma Hearing loss occurs or gets worse Prevention Take the following steps to help prevent hearing loss: Wear protective ear plugs or earmuffs to prevent hearing damage from loud equipment. Be aware of risks to your hearing from activities such as shooting guns, using chain saws, or driving motorcycles and snowmobiles. DO NOT listen to loud music for long periods of time.

Amniocentesis is a test that can be done during pregnancy to look for certain problems in the developing baby. These problems include: Birth defects Genetic problems Infection Lung development How the Test is Performed Amniocentesis removes a small amount of fluid from the sac around the baby in the womb (uterus). It is most often done in a doctor's office or medical center. You do not need to stay in the hospital. You will have a pregnancy ultrasound first. This helps your health care provider see where the baby is in your womb. Numbing medicine is then rubbed onto part of your belly. Sometimes, the medicine is given through a shot in the skin on the belly area. The skin is cleaned with a disinfecting liquid. Your provider inserts a long, thin needle through your belly and into your womb. A small amount of fluid (about 4 teaspoons or 20 milliliters) is removed from the sac surrounding the baby. In most cases, the baby is watched by ultrasound during the procedure. The fluid is sent to a laboratory. Testing may include: Genetic studies Measurement of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels (a substance produced in the liver of the developing baby) Culture for infection Results of genetic testing usually take about 2 weeks. Other test results come back in 1 to 3 days. Sometimes amniocentesis is also used later in pregnancy to: Diagnose infection Check whether the baby's lungs are developed and ready for delivery Remove excess fluid from around the baby if there is too much amniotic fluid ( polyhydramnios ) How to Prepare for the Test Your bladder may need to be full for the ultrasound. Check with your provider about this. Before the test, blood may be taken to find out your blood type and Rh factor. You may get a shot of medicine called Rho(D) Immune Globulin (RhoGAM and other brands) if you are Rh negative. Why the Test is Performed Amniocentesis is usually offered to women who are at increased risk of having a child with birth defects. This includes women who: Will be 35 or older when they give birth Had a screening test that shows there may be a birth defect or other problem Have had babies with birth defects in other pregnancies Have a family history of genetic disorders Genetic counseling is recommended before the procedure. This will allow you to: Learn about other prenatal tests Make an informed decision about options for prenatal diagnosis This test: Is a diagnostic test, not a screening test Is most often done between 15 to 20 weeks of your pregnancy, but can be performed at any time between 15 to 40 weeks Amniocentesis can be used to diagnose many different gene and chromosome problems in the baby, including: Anencephaly (when the baby is missing a large portion of the brain) Down syndrome Rare metabolic disorders that are passed down through families Other genetic problems, like trisomy 18 (also known as Edwards syndrome) Infections in the amniotic fluid Normal Results A normal result means: No genetic or chromosome problems found in your baby. Bilirubin and alpha-fetoprotein levels appear normal. No signs of infection found. Note: Amniocentesis typically is the most accurate test for genetic conditions and malformation, although rare, a baby may still have genetic or other types of birth defects, even if amniocentesis results are normal. What Abnormal Results Mean An abnormal result may mean your baby has: A gene or chromosome problem, such as Down syndrome or trisomy 18 Birth defects that involve the spine or brain, such as spina bifida Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. Ask your provider: How the condition or defect may be treated during or after your pregnancy What special needs your child may have after birth What other options you have about maintaining or ending your pregnancy Risks Risks are minimal, but may include: Infection or injury to the baby Miscarriage Leaking of amniotic fluid Vaginal bleeding Alternative Names Culture - amniotic fluid; Culture - amniotic cells; Alpha-fetoprotein - amniocentesis Images Amniocentesis Amniocentesis Amniocentesis - series References Driscoll DA, Simpson JL.

Acute kidney failure is the rapid (less than 2 days) loss of your kidneys' ability to remove waste and help balance fluids and electrolytes in your body. Causes There are many possible causes of kidney damage. They include: Acute tubular necrosis (ATN; damage to the tubule cells of the kidneys) Autoimmune kidney disease Blood clot in the blood vessels to the kidneys Decreased blood flow from cholesterol (cholesterol emboli) Decreased blood flow due to very low blood pressure, which can result from burns , dehydration , hemorrhage, injury, septic shock , serious illness, or surgery Disorders that cause clotting within the kidney blood vessels Infections that directly injure the kidney, such as acute pyelonephritis or septicemia Pregnancy complications, including placental abruption or placenta previa Urinary tract blockage Illicit drugs such as cocaine and heroin Medicines including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), certain antibiotics and blood pressure medicines, intravenous contrast (dye), some cancer and HIV medicines Symptoms Symptoms of acute kidney failure may include any of the following: Blood in the stools Blood in the urine Breath odor and metallic taste in the mouth Bruising easily Changes in mental status or mood Decreased appetite Decreased sensation , especially in the hands or feet Fatigue or slow sluggish movements Flank pain (between the ribs and hips) Hand tremor Heart murmur High blood pressure Nausea or vomiting, may last for days Nosebleeds Persistent hiccups Prolonged bleeding Seizures Shortness of breath Swelling due to the body keeping in fluid (may be seen in the legs, ankles, and feet) Urination changes, such as little or no urine, excessive urination at night , or urination that stops completely Exams and Tests Your health care provider will examine you. Tests to check how well your kidneys are working include: BUN (blood urea nitrogen) Creatinine clearance Serum creatinine Serum potassium and electrolyte levels Urinalysis Other blood tests may be done to find the underlying cause of kidney failure. A kidney or abdominal ultrasound is the preferred test for diagnosing a blockage in the urinary tract. X-ray , CT scan , or MRI of the abdomen can also tell if there is a blockage. Treatment Once the cause is found, the goal of treatment is to help your kidneys work again and prevent fluid and waste from building up in your body while they heal. Usually, you will have to stay overnight in the hospital for treatment. The amount of liquid you drink will be limited to the amount of urine you can produce. You will be told what you may and may not eat to reduce the buildup of toxins that the kidneys would normally remove. Your diet may need to be high in carbohydrates and low in protein , salt, and potassium. You may need antibiotics to treat or prevent infection. Water pills (diuretics) may be used to help remove fluid from your body. Medicines will be given through a vein to help control your blood potassium level. You may need dialysis . This is a treatment that does what healthy kidneys normally do -- rid the body of harmful wastes, extra salt, and water. Dialysis can save your life if your potassium levels are dangerously high. Dialysis will also be used if: Your mental status changes You develop pericarditis You retain too much fluid You cannot remove nitrogen waste products from your body Dialysis will most often be short term. In some cases, the kidney damage is so great that dialysis is needed permanently. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if your urine output slows or stops or you have other symptoms of acute kidney failure. Prevention To prevent acute kidney failure: Health problems such as high blood pressure or diabetes should be well controlled. Avoid drugs and medicines that can cause kidney injury.

Your immune system helps protect your body from foreign or harmful substances. Examples are bacteria, viruses, toxins, cancer cells, and blood or tissues from another person. The immune system makes cells and antibodies that destroy these harmful substances. AGING CHANGES AND THEIR EFFECTS ON THE IMMUNE SYSTEM As you grow older, your immune system does not work as well. The following immune system changes may occur: The immune system becomes slower to respond. This increases your risk of getting sick. Flu shots or other vaccines may not work as well or protect you for as long as expected. An autoimmune disorder may develop. This is a disease in which the immune system mistakenly attacks and damages or destroys healthy body tissues. Your body may heal more slowly. There are fewer immune cells in the body to bring about healing. The immune system's ability to detect and correct cell defects also declines. This can result in an increased risk of cancer . PREVENTION To decrease the risks from immune system aging: Get vaccines to prevent the flu, shingles, and pneumococcal infections, as well as any other vaccines your health care provider recommends. Get plenty of exercise. Exercise helps boost your immune system. Eat healthy foods. Good nutrition keeps your immune system strong. Do not smoke. Smoking weakens your immune system. Limit your intake of alcohol . Ask your provider how much alcohol is safe for you. Look into safety measures to prevent falls and injuries. A weak immune system can slow healing from injuries. OTHER CHANGES As you grow older, you will have other changes, including in your: Hormone production Organs, tissues, and cells Images Immune system structures References McDevitt MA.

Anal fissure: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia Skip navigation An official website of the United States government Here’s how you know Here’s how you know Official websites use .gov A .gov website belongs to an official government

An anal fissure is a small split or tear in the thin moist tissue ( mucosa ) lining the lower rectum (anus). Causes Anal fissures are very common in infants, but they may occur at any age. In adults, fissures may be caused by passing large, hard stools, or having diarrhea for a long time. Other factors may include: Decreased blood flow to the area Too much tension in the sphincter muscles that control the anus The condition affects males and females equally. Anal fissures are also common in women after childbirth and in people with Crohn disease . Symptoms An anal fissure can be seen as a crack in the anal skin when the area is stretched slightly. The fissure is almost always in the middle. Anal fissures may cause painful bowel movements and bleeding. There may be blood on the outside of the stool or on the toilet paper (or baby wipes) after a bowel movement. Symptoms may begin suddenly or develop slowly over time. Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform a rectal exam and look at the anal tissue. Other medical tests that may be done include: Anoscopy -- examination of the anus, anal canal, and lower rectum Sigmoidoscopy -- examination of the lower part of large intestine Biopsy -- removal of rectal tissue for examination Colonoscopy -- examination of the colon Treatment Most fissures heal on their own and do not need treatment. To prevent or treat anal fissures in infants, be sure to change diapers often and clean the area gently. CHILDREN AND ADULTS Worrying about pain during a bowel movement may cause a person to avoid them. But not having bowel movements will only cause the stools to become even harder, which can make the anal fissure worse. Prevent hard stools and constipation by: Making dietary changes -- eating more fiber or bulk , such as fruits, vegetables, and grains Drinking more fluids Using stool softeners Ask your provider about the following ointments or creams to help soothe the affected skin: Numbing cream, if pain interferes with normal bowel movements Petroleum jelly Zinc oxide, 1% hydrocortisone cream, Preparation H, and other products A sitz bath is a warm water bath used for healing or cleansing. Sit in the bath 2 to 3 times a day. The water should cover only the hips and buttocks. If the anal fissures do not go away with home care methods, treatment may involve: Botulinum toxin injections into the muscle in the anus (anal sphincter) Minor surgery to relax the anal muscle Prescription creams, such as nitrates or calcium channel blockers, applied over the fissure to help relax the muscles Outlook (Prognosis) Anal fissures often heal quickly without any more problems. People who develop fissures once are more likely to have them in the future.

Anencephaly is the absence of a large part of the brain and the skull. Causes Anencephaly is one of the most common neural tube defects. Neural tube defects are birth defects that affect the tissue that becomes the spinal cord and brain. Anencephaly occurs early in the development of an unborn baby. It results when the upper part of the neural tube fails to close. The exact cause is not known. Possible causes include: Environmental toxins Low intake of folic acid by the mother during pregnancy The exact number of cases of anencephaly is unknown. Many of these pregnancies result in miscarriage. Having one infant with this condition increases the risk of having another child with neural tube defects. Symptoms Symptoms of anencephaly are: Absence of the skull Absence of parts of the brain Facial feature abnormalities Severe developmental delay Heart defects may be present in 1 out of 5 cases. Exams and Tests An ultrasound during pregnancy is done to confirm the diagnosis. The ultrasound may reveal too much fluid in the uterus. This condition is called polyhydramnios . The mother may also have these tests during pregnancy: Amniocentesis (to look for increased levels of alpha-fetoprotein ) Alpha-fetoprotein level (increased levels suggest a neural tube defect) Urine estriol level A pre-pregnancy serum folic acid test may also be done. Treatment There is no current treatment. Talk to your health care provider about care decisions. Outlook (Prognosis) This condition most often causes death within a few days after birth. When to Contact a Medical Professional A provider usually detects this condition during routine prenatal testing and ultrasound. Otherwise, it is recognized at birth. If anencephaly is detected before birth, further counseling will be needed. Prevention There is good evidence that folic acid can help reduce the risk for certain birth defects, including anencephaly. Women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant should take a multivitamin with folic acid every day. Many foods are now fortified with folic acid to help prevent these kinds of birth defects. Getting enough folic acid can cut the chances of neural tube defects in half.

In people who have sensitive airways, allergy and asthma symptoms can be triggered by breathing in substances called allergens , or triggers. It is important to know your triggers because avoiding them is your first step toward feeling better. Dust is a common trigger. Dust and Dust Mites When your asthma or allergies become worse due to dust, you are said to have a dust allergy. Very tiny insects called dust mites are the main cause of dust allergies. Dust mites can only be seen under a microscope. Most dust mites in your home are found in bedding, mattresses, and box springs. House dust may also contain tiny particles of pollen, mold, fibers from clothing and fabrics, and detergents. All of these can also trigger allergies and asthma. Choose the Right Home Furnishings You can do many things to limit your or your child's exposure to dust and dust mites. Replace blinds that have slats and cloth draperies with pull-down shades. They will not collect as much dust. Dust particles collect in fabrics and carpets. If you can, get rid of fabric or upholstered furniture. Wood, leather, and vinyl are better. Avoid sleeping or lying on cushions and furniture that are covered in cloth. Replace wall-to-wall carpet with wood or other hard flooring. Since mattresses, box springs, and pillows are hard to avoid: Wrap them with mite-proof covers. Wash bedding and pillows once a week in hot water (130°F [54.4°C] to 140°F [60°C]). Other Tips Keep indoor air dry. Dust mites thrive in moist air. In the basement: Check your basement for moisture and mold. Use a dehumidifier to keep the air drier. Keeping indoor moisture levels (humidity) between 30% to 50% will keep mold spores down. Empty dehumidifiers daily and clean them often with a vinegar solution. Central heating and air-conditioning systems may help control dust. The system should include special filters to capture dust and animal dander. Change furnace filters frequently. Use high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. When cleaning: Wipe away dust with a damp cloth and vacuum once a week. Use a vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter to help control the dust that vacuuming stirs up. Use furniture polish to help reduce dust and other allergens. Wear a mask when you clean the house. You and your child should leave the house when others are cleaning, if possible. Keep stuffed toys off beds, and wash them weekly. Keep closets clean and closet doors closed.

Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is a rare and aggressive form of cancer of the thyroid gland. Causes Anaplastic thyroid cancer is an invasive type of thyroid cancer that grows very rapidly. It occurs most often in people over age 60. It is more common in females than in males. The cause is unknown. Anaplastic cancer accounts for only about less than 1% of all thyroid cancers in the United States. Symptoms Symptoms include: Cough Coughing up blood Difficulty swallowing Hoarseness or changing voice Loud breathing Lower neck lump, which often grows quickly Pain in the neck Vocal cord paralysis Overactive thyroid ( hyperthyroidism ) Exams and Tests A physical exam almost always shows a growth in the neck region. Other exams may include: An MRI or CT scan of the neck may show a tumor growing from the thyroid gland. A thyroid biopsy makes the diagnosis. The tumor tissue can be checked for genetic markers that may suggest targets for treatment, preferably within a clinical trial. An examination of the airway with a fiberoptic scope ( laryngoscopy ) may show a paralyzed vocal cord. A thyroid scan shows this growth to be "cold," meaning it does not absorb a radioactive substance. Thyroid function blood tests are normal in most cases. Treatment This type of cancer cannot be cured by surgery. Surgery combined with radiation therapy and chemotherapy may have a significant benefit. Surgery to place a tube in the throat to help with breathing (tracheostomy ) or in the stomach to help with eating (gastrostomy) may be needed during treatment. For some people, enrolling in a clinical trial of new thyroid cancer treatments based on the genetic changes in the tumor may be an option. The presence of a mutation in the BRAF gene is treatable with targeted medicines and may improve outcomes. Support Groups You can often ease the stress of illness by joining a support group of people sharing common experiences and problems. Outlook (Prognosis) The outlook with this disease is poor. Most people do not survive longer than 6 months because the disease is aggressive and there is a lack of effective treatment options. Possible Complications Complications may include: Spread of tumor within the neck Metastasis (spread) of cancer to other body tissues or organs When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your health care provider if you notice: A persistent lump or mass in the neck Hoarseness or changes in your voice Cough or coughing up blood Alternative Names Anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid Images Thyroid cancer - CT scan Thyroid gland References Bible KC, Kebebew E, Brierley J, et al. 2021 American Thyroid Association guidelines for management of patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer.

Albinism is a lack of melanin production. Melanin is a natural substance in the body that gives color to your hair, skin, and iris of the eye. Causes Albinism occurs when one of several genetic changes makes the body unable to produce or distribute melanin . These changes may be passed down (inherited) through families. The most severe form of albinism is called oculocutaneous albinism. People with this type of albinism have white or pink hair, skin, and iris color. They also have vision problems. Another type of albinism, called ocular albinism type 1 (OA1), affects only the eyes. The person's skin and eye color are usually in the normal range. However, an eye exam will show that there is no coloring in the back of the eye (retina). Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a form of albinism caused by a change to a single gene. It can occur with a bleeding disorder, as well as with lung, kidney, and bowel diseases. Symptoms A person with albinism may have one of these symptoms: No color in the hair, skin, or iris of the eye Lighter than normal skin and hair Patches of missing skin color Many forms of albinism are associated with the following symptoms: Crossed eyes Light sensitivity Rapid eye movements Vision problems, or functional blindness Exams and Tests Genetic testing offers the most accurate way to diagnose the specific type of albinism. Such testing is helpful if you have a family history of albinism. It is also useful for certain groups of people who are known to get the disease. Your health care provider may also diagnose the condition based on the appearance of your skin, hair, and eyes. An eye doctor called an ophthalmologist may perform an electroretinogram . This is a test that can reveal vision problems related to albinism. A test called a visual evoked potentials test can be very useful when the diagnosis is uncertain. Treatment The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms. It will depend on how severe the disorder is. Treatment involves protecting the skin and eyes from the sun. To do this: Reduce sunburn risk by avoiding the sun, using sunscreen, and covering up completely with clothing when exposed to the sun. Use sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF). Wear sunglasses (UV protected) to help relieve light sensitivity. Glasses are often prescribed to correct vision problems and eye position. Eye muscle surgery is sometimes recommended to correct abnormal eye movements. Support Groups More information and support for people with albinism and their families can be found at: National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation -- www.albinism.org NIH Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center -- rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/5768/albinism National Library of Medicine - MedlinePlus website. Ocular albinism. -- medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/ocular-albinism/ Outlook (Prognosis) Albinism does not usually affect lifespan. However, the HPS form of albinism can shorten a person's lifespan due to lung disease or bleeding problems. People with albinism may be limited in their outdoor activities because they can't tolerate the sun. Possible Complications These complications can occur: Decreased vision, blindness Skin cancer When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have albinism or symptoms such as light sensitivity that cause discomfort. Also contact your provider if you notice any skin changes that might be an early sign of skin cancer. Prevention Because albinism is inherited, genetic counseling is important. People with a family history of albinism or very light coloring should consider genetic counseling. Alternative Names Oculocutaneous albinism; Ocular albinism Images Melanin References Joyce JC.

Anti-DNase B is a blood test to look for antibodies to a substance (protein) produced by group A streptococcus . This is the bacteria that cause strep throat . When used together with the ASO titer test , more than 90% of past streptococcal infections can be identified. How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed . How to Prepare for the Test No special preparation is necessary. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed This test is most often done to tell if you have previously had a strep infection and if you might have rheumatic fever or kidney problems ( glomerulonephritis ) due to that infection. Normal Results A negative test is normal. Some people have low concentrations of antibodies, but they have not had a recent strep infection. Therefore, normal values in different age groups are: Adults: less than 85 units/milliliter (mL) School-age children: less than 170 units/mL Preschool children: less than 60 units/mL Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different specimens. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean Increased levels of DNase B levels indicate exposure to group A streptococcus. Risks There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Multiple punctures to locate veins Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names Strep throat - anti-DNase B test; Antideoxyribonuclease B titer; ADN-B test Images Blood test References Bryant AE, Stevens DL.

The brain and nervous system are your body's central control center. They control your body's: Movements Senses Thoughts and memories They also help control the organs such as your heart and bowels. Nerves are the pathways that carry signals to and from your brain and the rest of your body. The spinal cord is the bundle of nerves that runs from your brain down the center of your back. Nerves extend out from the spinal cord to every part of your body. AGING CHANGES AND THEIR EFFECTS ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM As you age, your brain and nervous system go through natural changes. Your brain and spinal cord lose nerve cells and weight (atrophy). Nerve cells may begin to pass messages more slowly than in the past. Waste products or other chemicals such as beta amyloid can collect in the brain tissue as nerve cells break down. This can cause abnormal changes in the brain called plaques and tangles to form. A fatty brown pigment ( lipofuscin ) can also build up in nerve tissue. Breakdown of nerves can affect your senses. You might have reduced or lost reflexes or sensation. This leads to problems with movement and safety and makes it more likely to suffer falls. Slowing of thought, memory, and thinking is a normal part of aging. These changes are not the same in everyone. Some people have many changes in their nerves and brain tissue. Others have few changes. These changes are not always related to the effects on your ability to think. NERVOUS SYSTEM PROBLEMS IN OLDER PEOPLE Dementia and severe memory loss are not a normal part of aging. They can be caused by brain diseases such as Alzheimer disease , which doctors believe is associated with plaques and tangles forming in the brain. Delirium is sudden confusion that leads to changes in thinking and behavior. It is often due to illnesses that are not related to the brain. Infection can cause an older person to become severely confused. Certain medicines can also cause or complicate this. Thinking and behavior problems can also be caused by poorly controlled diabetes . Rising and falling blood sugar levels can interfere with thought. Talk with your health care provider if you have any changes in: Memory Thought Ability to perform a task Seek medical help right away if these symptoms occur suddenly or along with other symptoms. A change in thinking, memory, or behavior is important if it is different from your normal patterns or it affects your lifestyle. PREVENTION Mental and physical exercise can help your brain stay sharp. Mental exercises include: Reading Doing crossword puzzles Stimulating conversation Physical exercise promotes blood flow to your brain. It also helps reduce loss of brain cells. OTHER CHANGES As you grow older, you will have other changes, including: In organs, tissues, and cells In the heart and blood vessels In the vital signs In the senses Images Brain and nervous system Alzheimer disease References Basco MD, Gorgon EJ, Barredo R, Schulte OJ, Stephens J, Ann J.

Angina is a type of chest discomfort or pain due to poor blood flow through the blood vessels (coronary vessels) of the heart muscle (myocardium). Typically, the chest pain feels like tightness, heavy pressure, squeezing, or a crushing feeling. It may spread to the: Arm (most often the left) Back Jaw Neck Shoulder Some people say the pain feels like gas or indigestion. Some patients have symptoms other than classic angina when there is poor blood flow to the heart which may be called their "anginal equivalent." Examples include shortness of breath, back, jaw or arm pain that occur without chest pain. There are different types of angina: Stable angina Unstable angina Variant angina Get medical help right away if you have new, unexplained chest pain or pressure. If you have had angina before, call your health care provider. Patient Instructions Angina - discharge Angioplasty and stent - heart - discharge Antiplatelet drugs - P2Y12 inhibitors Aspirin and heart disease Being active after your heart attack Being active when you have heart disease Butter, margarine, and cooking oils Cardiac catheterization - discharge Cholesterol - drug treatment Controlling your high blood pressure Dietary fats explained Fast food tips Heart bypass surgery - discharge Heart bypass surgery - minimally invasive - discharge Heart disease - risk factors Heart failure - discharge Heart failure - home monitoring Low-salt diet Mediterranean diet References Boden WE.

Apnea means "without breath" and refers to breathing that slows down or stops from any cause. Apnea of prematurity refers to breathing pauses in babies who were born before 37 weeks of pregnancy ( premature birth). Most premature babies have some degree of apnea because the area of the brain that controls breathing is still developing. Causes There are several reasons why newborns, in particular those who were born early (prematurely), may have apnea, including: The brain areas and nerve pathways that control breathing are still developing. The muscles that keep the airway open are smaller and not as strong as they will be later in life. Other stresses in a sick or premature baby may worsen apnea, including: Anemia Feeding problems Heart or lung problems Infection Low oxygen levels Temperature problems Symptoms The breathing pattern of newborns is not always regular and may be called "periodic breathing." This pattern is even more likely in newborns born early. It consists of episodes of either shallow breathing or short pauses in breathing lasting just a few seconds. These episodes are then followed by periods of regular breathing. This is generally considered a normal pattern and can be expected in less mature and even some full-term babies. However, the pattern of breathing, length of breathing pauses, and the age of the baby are both important when deciding if it needs to be further evaluated. Apnea episodes or "events" that last longer than 20 seconds are considered serious. The baby may also have a: Drop in heart rate. This heart rate drop is called bradycardia (also called a "brady"). Drop in oxygen level (oxygen saturation). This is called desaturation (also called a "desat"). Exams and Tests All premature babies under 35 weeks gestation are admitted to newborn intensive care units, or special care nurseries, with special monitors because they are at higher risk for apnea. Older babies who are found to have apnea episodes will also be placed on monitors in the hospital. More tests will be done if the baby is not preterm and appears unwell. Monitors keep track of breathing rate, heart rate, and oxygen levels. Drops in breathing rate, heart rate, or oxygen level can set off the alarms on these monitors. Baby monitors marketed for home use are not the same as those used in the hospital. Alarms may occur for other reasons (such as passing stool or moving around), so the monitor tracings are reviewed regularly by the health care team. Treatment How apnea is treated depends on: The cause How often it occurs Severity of episodes Babies who are otherwise healthy and have occasional minor episodes are simply watched. In these cases, the episodes go away when the babies are gently touched or "stimulated" during periods when breathing stops. Babies who are well, but who are very premature and/or have many apnea episodes may be given caffeine. This will help make their breathing pattern more regular. Sometimes, the nurse will change a baby's position, use suction to remove fluid or mucus from the mouth or nose, or use a bag and mask to help with breathing. Breathing can be assisted by: Proper positioning Slower feeding time Oxygen Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) Breathing machine ( ventilator ) in extreme cases Some infants who continue to have apnea but are otherwise mature and healthy may be discharged from the hospital on a home apnea monitor, with or without caffeine, until they have outgrown their immature breathing pattern. Outlook (Prognosis) Apnea is common in premature babies. Mild apnea does not appear to have long-term effects. However, preventing multiple or severe episodes is better for the baby over the long-term. Apnea of prematurity most often goes away as the baby approaches their "due date." In some cases, such as in infants who were born very prematurely or have severe lung disease, apnea may persist a few weeks longer.

Alcohol use disorder is when your drinking causes serious problems in your life, yet you keep drinking. You may also need more and more alcohol to feel drunk. Stopping suddenly may cause withdrawal symptoms . Causes No one knows what causes problems with alcohol. Health experts think that it may be a combination of a person's: Genes Environment Psychology, such as being impulsive or having low self-esteem Long-term risks of drinking an excessive amount of alcohol are more likely if: You are a man who has more than 2 drinks per day, or 15 or more drinks a week, or often has 5 or more drinks at a time You are a woman who has more than 1 drink per day, or 8 or more drinks a week, or often has 4 or more drinks at a time One drink is defined as 12 ounces or 360 milliliters (mL) of beer (5% alcohol content), 5 ounces or 150 mL of wine (12% alcohol content), or a 1.5-ounce or 45-mL shot of liquor (80 proof, or 40% alcohol content). If you have a parent with alcohol use disorder, you are more at risk for alcohol problems. You also may be more likely to have problems with alcohol if you: Are a young adult under peer pressure Have depression , bipolar disorder , anxiety disorders , post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) , or schizophrenia Can easily obtain alcohol Have low self-esteem Have problems with relationships Live a stressful lifestyle If you are concerned about your drinking, it may help to take a careful look at your alcohol use . Symptoms Health care providers have developed a list of symptoms that a person has to have in the past year to be diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. Symptoms may include: Drinking more or longer than you planned to at times Wanting to or trying to cut down or stop drinking, but could not Spending a lot of time and effort to get alcohol, use it, or recover from its effects Craving alcohol or having a strong urge to use it Missing work or school, or not performing as well because of drinking Continuing to drink, even when it harms your relationships with family and friends No longer taking part in activities that you used to enjoy Getting into situations that can cause you to get hurt, such as driving, using machinery, or having unsafe sex while or after drinking Continuing to drink, even though it is making a health problem caused by alcohol worse Needing more and more alcohol to feel its effects or to get drunk (this is called tolerance) Getting withdrawal symptoms when the effects of alcohol wear off Exams and Tests Your provider will: Examine you Ask about your medical and family history Ask about your alcohol use, and if you have any of the symptoms listed above Your provider may order tests to check for health problems that are common in people who use alcohol. These tests may include: Blood alcohol level (This shows if you have recently been drinking alcohol. It does not diagnose alcohol use disorder.) Complete blood count Liver function tests Magnesium blood test Treatment Many people with an alcohol problem need to completely stop using alcohol. This is called abstinence. Having strong social and family support can help make it easier to quit drinking. Some people are able to just cut back on their drinking. So even if you do not totally give up alcohol, you may be able to drink less . This can improve your health and relationships with others. It can also help you perform better at work or school. However, many people who drink too much find they can't just cut back. Abstinence may be the only way to manage a drinking problem. DECIDING TO QUIT Like many people with an alcohol problem, you may not recognize that your drinking has gotten out of your control. An important first step is to be aware of how much you drink . It also helps to understand the health risks of alcohol . If you decide to quit drinking , talk with your provider. Treatment involves helping you realize how much your alcohol use is harming your life and the lives of those around you. Depending on how much and how long you have been drinking, you may be at risk for alcohol withdrawal. Withdrawal can be very uncomfortable and even life threatening. If you have been drinking a lot, you should cut back or stop drinking only under the care of a provider. Talk with your provider about how to stop using alcohol . LONG-TERM SUPPORT Alcohol recovery or support programs can help you stop drinking completely. These programs usually offer: Education about alcohol use and its effects Counseling and therapy to discuss how to control your thoughts and behaviors Physical health care For the best chance of success, you should live with people who support your efforts to avoid alcohol. Some programs offer housing options for people with alcohol problems. Depending on your needs and the programs that are available: You may be treated in a special recovery center (inpatient) You may attend a program while you live at home (outpatient) You may be prescribed medicines along with counseling and behavioral therapy to help you quit. This is called medication-assisted treatment (MAT). While MAT doesn't work for everyone, it is another option in treating the disorder. These medicines are often used for MAT. Acamprosate helps reduce cravings and dependence on alcohol in people who have recently stopped drinking. Disulfiram should only be used after you stop drinking. It causes a very bad reaction when you drink, which helps prevent you from drinking. Naltrexone blocks pleasurable feelings of intoxication, which may help you cut back or stop drinking. It's a common misconception that taking medicine to treat alcohol use disorder is trading one addiction for another. These medicines are not addictive. They can help some people manage the disorder, just as people with diabetes or heart disease take medicine to treat their condition. Drinking may mask depression or other mood or anxiety disorders. If you have a mood disorder, it may become more noticeable when you stop drinking. Your provider will treat any mental disorders in addition to your alcohol treatment. Drinking significantly may also cause depression and anxiety. You need to stop drinking for at least a month to see if these symptoms get better and do not need further treatment. Support Groups Support groups help many people who are dealing with alcohol use. Talk to your provider about a support group that might be right for you. Outlook (Prognosis) How well a person does depends on whether they can successfully cut back or stop drinking. It may take several tries to stop drinking for good. If you are struggling to quit, do not give up hope. Getting treatment, if needed, along with support and encouragement from support groups and those around you can help you remain sober. Possible Complications Alcohol use disorder can increase your risk of many health problems, including: Bleeding in the digestive tract Brain cell damage A brain disorder called Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome Cancer of the mouth, throat, esophagus, stomach, liver, colon, and breast Changes in the menstrual cycle Delirium tremens (DTs) Dementia and memory loss Depression and suicide Erectile dysfunction Heart damage High blood pressure Inflammation of the pancreas ( pancreatitis ) Liver disease, including cirrhosis Nerve and brain damage Poor nutrition Sleeping problems ( insomnia ) Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) Alcohol use also increases your risk for violence. Drinking alcohol while you are pregnant can lead to severe birth defects in your baby. This is called fetal alcohol syndrome . Drinking alcohol while you are breastfeeding can also cause problems for your baby. When to Contact a Medical Professional Talk with your provider if you or someone you know may have an alcohol problem. Seek immediate medical care or call 911 or the local emergency number if you or someone you know has an alcohol problem and develops severe confusion, seizures, or bleeding. If you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org . You can also call 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides free and confidential support 24/7, anytime day or night.

Alcohol withdrawal refers to symptoms that may occur when a person who has been drinking too much alcohol on a regular basis suddenly stops drinking alcohol. Causes Alcohol withdrawal occurs most often in adults. But it may also occur in teenagers or children. The more often you drink, the more likely you are to have alcohol withdrawal symptoms when you stop drinking. You may have more severe withdrawal symptoms if you have certain other medical problems. Symptoms Alcohol withdrawal symptoms tend to occur within 8 hours after the last drink, but can occur days later. Symptoms tend to peak by 24 to 72 hours, but may go on for weeks. Common symptoms include: Anxiety or nervousness Depression Fatigue Irritability Jumpiness or shakiness Mood swings Nightmares Not thinking clearly Other symptoms may include: Sweating , clammy skin Enlarged (dilated) pupils Headache Insomnia (sleeping difficulty) Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Pallor Rapid heart rate Sweating, clammy skin Tremor of the hands or other body parts Delirium tremens is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal. It can cause: Agitation , irritability Sudden, severe confusion (delirium) Fever Seeing or feeling things that aren't there (hallucinations) Seizures Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may reveal: Abnormal eye movements Abnormal heart rhythms Dehydration (not enough fluids in the body) Fever Rapid breathing Rapid heart rate Shaky hands Blood and urine tests, including testing for toxins and drugs, may be done. An electrocardiogram (ECG) may also be done. Treatment The goals of treatment are to: Reduce withdrawal symptoms Prevent complications of alcohol use Help you to reduce or stop drinking alcohol INPATIENT TREATMENT People with moderate-to-severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms may need to be treated at a hospital or other facility that treats alcohol withdrawal. You will be watched closely for hallucinations and other signs of delirium tremens. Treatment may include: Monitoring blood pressure, body temperature, heart rate, and blood levels of different chemicals in the body Giving fluids or medicines through a vein (by IV) Giving sedatives until withdrawal is complete OUTPATIENT TREATMENT If you have mild-to-moderate alcohol withdrawal symptoms, you can often be treated in an outpatient setting. During this process, you will need someone to stay with you and keep an eye on you. You will likely need to make daily visits to your provider until you are stable. Treatment usually includes: Sedatives to help ease withdrawal symptoms Blood tests Patient and family counseling for alcohol use issues Testing and treatment for other medical problems linked to alcohol use It is important to go to a living situation that supports you in avoiding unhealthy alcohol use. Some areas have housing options that provide a supportive environment for those trying to stay sober. Total and lifelong avoidance of alcohol (abstinence) is the best treatment for those who have gone through alcohol withdrawal. Support Groups More information and support for people with alcohol use disorder and their families can be found at: Alcoholics Anonymous -- www.aa.org Al-Anon Family Groups/Al-Anon/Alateen -- al-anon.org National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism -- www.niaaa.nih.gov SMART Recovery - www.smartrecovery.org/ Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration -- www.samhsa.gov/atod/alcohol Outlook (Prognosis) How well a person does depends on the amount of organ damage and whether the person can stop drinking completely. Alcohol withdrawal may range from a mild and uncomfortable disorder to a serious, life-threatening condition. Symptoms such as sleep changes, rapid changes in mood, and fatigue may last for months. People who continue to drink a lot may develop health problems such as liver, heart, and nervous system disease. Most people who go through alcohol withdrawal make a full recovery. But, death is possible, especially if delirium tremens occurs. When to Contact a Medical Professional Alcohol withdrawal is a serious condition that may quickly become life-threatening. Call your provider or go the emergency room if you think you might be in alcohol withdrawal, especially if you were using alcohol often and recently stopped. Call for an appointment with your provider if symptoms persist after treatment. Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if seizures, fever, severe confusion, hallucinations, or irregular heartbeats occur. If you go to the hospital for another reason, tell the providers if you've been drinking heavily so they can monitor you for symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Prevention Reduce or avoid alcohol. If you have a drinking problem, it is best to stop drinking alcohol completely . Total and lifelong avoidance of alcohol (abstinence) is the safest approach.

Herbal remedies are plants used like a medicine. People use herbal remedies to help prevent or cure disease. They use them to get relief from symptoms, boost energy, relax, or lose weight. Herbal remedies are not regulated or tested like medicines. How can you know what you are getting and if it is useful? This guide can help you choose and use herbals safely. Herbals are not Medicines You have to be careful when using an herbal remedy. Herbal remedies are a type of dietary supplement. They are not medicines. Here are some things you should know about herbals: Herbals are not regulated like medicines. Herbals do not need to be rigidly tested before they are sold. Herbals may not work as claimed. Labels do not need to be approved by any authority. It may not list the correct amount of an ingredient. Some herbal remedies may contain ingredients or contaminants not listed on the label. Natural Does not Mean Safe Many people think that using plants to treat illness is safer than taking medicine. People have been using plants in folk medicine for centuries. So, it is easy to see the appeal. Yet "natural" does not mean safe. Unless taken as directed, some herbals can interact with other medicines or be toxic at high doses. Also, some may cause side effects. Here are some examples: Kava is an herb used for anxiety, insomnia, symptoms of menopause, and other ailments. Some studies show it may work for anxiety. But kava can also cause severe liver damage. The FDA has issued a warning against its use. St. John's Wort may work for mild to moderate depression. However, it can interact with birth control pills, antidepressants, and other drugs. It can also cause side effects such as stomach upset and anxiety. Yohimbe is a bark used to treat erectile dysfunction. The bark can cause high blood pressure, increased heart rate, anxiety, and other side effects. It can interact with certain medicines for depression. Taking it in high does or for a long time can be dangerous. Of course, some herbals have been tested and work well for their intended purpose. Many are also quite safe, but the word "natural" will not tell you which ones are safe and which ones are not safe. How to Choose and use Herbal Remedies Safely Some herbals can make you feel better and help keep you healthy. But you need to be a smart consumer. Use these tips when choosing herbal remedies. Look closely at the claims made about the product. How is the product described? Is it a "miracle" pill that "melts away" fat? Will it work faster than regular care? Is it a secret your health care provider and drug companies don't want you to know? Such claims are red flags. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is not. Remember "real-life stories" are not scientific proof. Many products are promoted with real-life stories. Even if the quote comes from a provider, there's no proof that other people will get the same results. Before trying a product, talk with your provider. Ask for their opinion. Is the product safe? What are the chances it will work? Are their risks? Will it interact with other medicines? Will it interfere with your treatment? Buy only from companies that have certification on the label, such as "USP Verified" or "ConsumerLab.com Approved Quality." Companies with these certifications agree to test the purity and quality of their products. Do not give herbal supplements to children or use them if you are older than age 65 years. Talk to your provider first. Do not use herbals without talking to your provider if you are taking any medicines. Do not use them if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. Do not use them if you are having surgery. Always let your provider know what herbals you use. They can affect the medicines you take as well any treatment you receive.

The antinuclear antibody panel is a blood test that looks at antinuclear antibodies (ANA). ANA are antibodies produced by the immune system that bind to the body's own tissues. The antinuclear antibody test looks for antibodies that bind to a part of the cell called the nucleus. If the test is positive, a panel of tests may be done to identify specific antibodies. This is the ANA antibody panel. How the Test is Performed Blood is drawn from a vein. Most often, a vein on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand is used. The site is cleaned with germ-killing medicine (antiseptic). The health care provider wraps an elastic band around the upper arm to apply pressure to the area and make the vein swell with blood. Next, the provider gently inserts a needle into the vein. The blood collects into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle. The elastic band is removed from your arm. Once the blood has been collected, the needle is removed, and the puncture site is covered to stop any bleeding. In infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin and make it bleed. The blood collects into a small glass tube called a pipette, or onto a slide or test strip. A bandage may be placed over the area if there is any bleeding. Depending on the laboratory, the test may be processed in different ways. One method requires a technician to examine a blood sample under a microscope using ultraviolet light. The other uses an automated instrument to record the results. How to Prepare for the Test No special preparation is needed. However, certain drugs, including birth control pills, procainamide, and thiazide diuretics, affect the accuracy of this test. Make sure your provider knows about all the medicines you take. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others may feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing. Why the Test is Performed You may need this test if you have signs of an autoimmune disorder, such as unexplained symptoms including arthritis , rashes, fevers or chest pain. Suspected systemic lupus erythematosus may be the most common reason why the test is done. Normal Results ANA test results are most often reported in 2 parts: the level or titer and the pattern. Titres are reported in ratios, most often 1:40, 1:80, 1:160, 1:320, and 1:640. Some, but not all labs will report a titre above 1:160 as positive. Patterns that are reported include, homogeneous, speckled, centromere, and others. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens. Further tests can be run on blood with a positive ANA test to get more information. What Abnormal Results Mean A positive ANA is not enough to make a diagnosis. To diagnose any disease related to a positive ANA, it is important to have: A full assessment by a doctor who specializes in any of the illnesses listed below Further antibody testing, for certain illnesses To make the diagnosis of SLE, the following must be present Certain clinical features Positive ANA results (a lack of ANA makes the diagnosis much less likely) Certain specific ANA antibodies, which help to confirm the diagnosis Other disorders besides SLE where positive ANA results strongly suggest a diagnosis include: Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) Sjögren syndrome (primary) Myositis (inflammatory muscle disease) Drug-induced lupus erythematosus Other common diseases that ANA testing can help diagnose include: Mixed connective tissue disease Polymyositis/dermatomyositis Autoimmune hepatitis EB virus Hepatitis C HIV Lymphomas Rheumatoid arthritis Thyroid disease Parvovirus Risks Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Considerations The ANA can be positive in relatives of people with SLE who do not have SLE themselves. There is a very low chance of developing SLE at some time later in life if the only finding is a low titer of ANA.

The aorta is the main blood vessel that supplies blood to the abdomen, pelvis, and legs. An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) occurs when an area of the aorta in the abdomen becomes very large or balloons out. Causes The exact cause of an aneurysm is unknown. It occurs due to weakness in the wall of the artery. Factors that can increase your risk of having this problem include: Smoking High blood pressure Male sex Genetic factors An abdominal aortic aneurysm is most often seen in males over age 60 who have one or more risk factors. The larger the aneurysm, the more likely it is to break open or tear . This can be life threatening. Symptoms Aneurysms can develop slowly over many years, often with no symptoms. Symptoms may come on quickly if the aneurysm expands rapidly, tears open or leaks blood within the wall of the vessel (aortic dissection). Symptoms of rupture include: Pain in the abdomen or back. The pain may be severe, sudden, persistent, or constant. It may spread to the groin, buttocks, or legs. Passing out. Clammy skin . Dizziness. Nausea and vomiting. Rapid heart rate . Shock . Exams and Tests Your health care provider will examine your abdomen and feel the pulses in your legs. The provider may find: A lump (mass) in the abdomen Pulsating sensation in the abdomen Stiff or rigid abdomen Your provider may find this problem by doing the following tests: Ultrasound of the abdomen when the abdominal aneurysm is first suspected CT scan of the abdomen to confirm the size of the aneurysm CTA (computed tomographic angiogram) to help with surgical planning Any one of these tests may be done when you are having symptoms. You may have an abdominal aortic aneurysm that is not causing any symptoms. Your provider may order an ultrasound of the abdomen to screen for an aneurysm. Most men who are age 65 to 75, who have smoked during their life should have this test one time. Some men who are age 65 to 75, who have never smoked during their life may need this test one time. Treatment If you have bleeding inside your body from an aortic aneurysm, you will need surgery right away. If the aneurysm is small and there are no symptoms: Surgery is rarely done. You and your provider must decide if the risk of having surgery is smaller than the risk of bleeding if you do not have surgery. Your provider will want to check the size of the aneurysm with ultrasound tests. The recommended frequency depends on the size of your aneurysm. Ask your provider what is best for you. Most of the time, surgery is done if the aneurysm is bigger than 2 inches (5 centimeters) across or growing quickly. The goal is to do surgery before complications develop. There are two types of surgery: Open repair - A large cut is made in your abdomen. The abnormal vessel is replaced with a graft made of man-made material. Endovascular stent grafting - This procedure can be done without making a large cut in your abdomen, so you may recover more quickly. This may be a safer approach if you have certain other medical problems or are an older adult. Endovascular repair can sometimes be done for a leaking or bleeding aneurysm. Outlook (Prognosis) The outcome is often good if you have surgery to repair the aneurysm before it ruptures. When an abdominal aortic aneurysm begins to tear or ruptures, it is a medical emergency. Only about 1 in 5 people survive a ruptured abdominal aneurysm. When to Contact a Medical Professional Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have pain in your belly or back that is very bad or does not go away. Prevention To reduce the risk of aneurysms: Eat a heart-healthy diet, exercise, stop smoking (if you smoke), and reduce stress. If you have high blood pressure or diabetes, take your medicines as your provider has told you. People over age 65 who have ever smoked should have a screening ultrasound done once.

Achondroplasia is a disorder of bone growth that causes the most common type of dwarfism. Causes Achondroplasia is one of a group of conditions called chondrodystrophies or osteochondrodysplasias. These rare genetic disorders cause problems with the development of bone, cartilage, and connective tissue. Achondroplasia is caused by a change (mutation) in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. This prevents bone growth and mainly affects the long bones in the arms and legs. People with achondroplasia have a short stature, with an average height under 4 feet 6 inches (137 centimeters). Achondroplasia may be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. This means that if a child gets the defective gene from one parent, the child will have the disorder. If one parent has achondroplasia, the infant has a 50% chance of inheriting the disorder. If both parents have the condition, the infant's chance of being affected increases to 75%. However, most cases (about 80%) appear as spontaneous mutations. This means that two parents without achondroplasia may give birth to a baby with the condition. Symptoms Achondroplastic dwarfism results in the following: Unusually large head Large forehead and flat bridge of the nose Crowded or crooked teeth Short stature (well below the average height for a person of the same age and sex) Average size trunk with short arms and legs (especially the upper arms and thighs) Bowed legs Limited range of motion of the elbows Spine curvatures called kyphosis and lordosis Short fingers with an extra space between the ring and middle finger (trident hand) Decreased muscle tone in infants Almost all people with achondroplasia have normal intelligence and will have a normal lifespan. Children with the disorder may develop at a slower rate than other children the same age. Exams and Tests During pregnancy, a prenatal ultrasound may show excessive amniotic fluid surrounding the unborn infant. Examination of the infant after birth shows increased front-to-back head size. X-rays of the long bones can reveal achondroplasia in the newborn. CT scan or MRI of the brain may be done if there are signs of "water on the brain" ( hydrocephalus ). Neuroimaging is needed to check the base of the head to look for signs of spinal cord compression. Sleep studies help detect problems with sleep apnea. Children with achondroplasia will need ongoing monitoring as they grow to check for health problems that can develop. Treatment There is no specific treatment for achondroplasia. The disorder may cause certain health conditions, which need to be treated when they cause problems. Obstructive sleep apnea can be treated with surgery and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices. Children who have recurring ear infections may need surgery to place tubes in their eardrums. Obesity can put extra strain on the body, so learning to eat a healthy diet and avoid weight gain from a young age is important. Bracing may be needed to help correct upper spine curvature (kyphosis). Hydrocephalus can be treated with surgery (ventriculoperitoneal shunting). Physical therapy can help if gait is affected due to lordosis (curving of the lower back). Corrective surgery may be needed if there are problems walking due to bowed legs. Spine surgery may be needed to relieve pressure on the spinal cord due to spinal stenosis or spinal cord compression at the base of the skull. Vosoritide (Voxzogo) is a new medicine approved for use in children age 5 years and older who are still growing. This once daily injection may slightly improve bone growth. Children and adults will need adaptations to their home, school, and work environment to accommodate a shorter stature. Support Groups Being physically different from others can be difficult for children who may be made fun of or bullied. Even in adulthood, people with dwarfism may be stared at or treated differently. Connecting with others affected by the disorder can help children and their families feel less alone. More information and support for people with achondroplasia and their families can be found at: Human Growth Foundation - www.hgfound.org/support-groups Little People of America - www.lpaonline.org MAGIC Foundation - www.magicfoundation.org Outlook (Prognosis) Adult heights typically are 46 to 57 inches (1.18 to 1.45 meters) for men and 44 to 54 inches (1.12 to 1.36 meters) for women. Intelligence is in the normal range. Infants who receive the abnormal gene from both parents do not often live beyond a few months. People with achondroplasia should have regular checkups throughout their life, as the condition can cause other health problems. Most problems can be treated. Possible Complications Complications that may develop include: Breathing problems from a small upper airway and from pressure on the area of the brain that controls breathing Lung problems from a small ribcage Narrowing of the spinal column (spinal stenosis) Pressure on the spinal column at the base of the neck Hydrocephalus Back pain and joint problems When to Contact a Medical Professional If there is a family history of achondroplasia and you plan to have children, you may find it helpful to speak to your health care provider. Prevention Genetic counseling may be helpful for prospective parents when one or both have achondroplasia. However, because achondroplasia most often develops spontaneously, prevention is not always possible.

Autonomic dysreflexia is an abnormal, overreaction of the involuntary (autonomic) nervous system to stimulation. This reaction may include: Change in heart rate Excessive sweating High blood pressure Muscle spasms Skin color changes (paleness, redness, blue-gray skin color) Causes The most common cause of autonomic dysreflexia (AD) is spinal cord injury. The nervous system of people with AD over-responds to the types of stimulation that do not bother healthy people. Other causes include: Guillain-Barré syndrome (disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks part of the nervous system) Side effects of some medicines Severe head trauma and other brain injuries Subarachnoid hemorrhage (a form of brain bleeding) Use of illegal stimulant drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines Symptoms Symptoms can include any of the following: Anxiety or worry Bladder or bowel problems Blurry vision, widened (dilated) pupils Lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting Fever Goosebumps, flushed (red) skin above the level of the spinal cord injury Heavy sweating High blood pressure Irregular heartbeat, slow or fast pulse Muscle spasms, especially in the jaw Nasal congestion Throbbing headache Sometimes there are no symptoms, even with a dangerous rise in blood pressure. Exams and Tests The health care provider will do a complete nervous system and medical examination. Tell the provider about all the medicines you are taking now and that you took in the past. This helps determine which tests you need. Tests may include: Blood and urine tests CT or MRI scan ECG (measurement of the heart's electrical activity) Lumbar puncture Tilt-table testing (testing of blood pressure as the body position changes) Toxicology screening (tests for any drugs, including medicines, in your bloodstream) X-rays Other conditions share many symptoms with AD, but have a different cause. The exam and testing help the provider rule out these other conditions, including: Carcinoid syndrome (tumors of the small intestine, colon, appendix, and bronchial tubes in the lungs) Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a condition caused by some medicines that leads to muscle stiffness, high fever, and drowsiness) Pheochromocytoma (tumor of the adrenal gland) Serotonin syndrome (drug reaction that causes the body to have too much serotonin, a chemical produced by nerve cells) Thyroid storm (life-threatening condition from an overactive thyroid) Treatment AD is life threatening, so it is important to quickly find and treat the problem. A person with symptoms of AD should: Sit up and raise the head Remove tight clothing Proper treatment depends on the cause. If medicines or illegal drugs are causing the symptoms, those drugs must be stopped. Any illness needs to be treated. For example, the provider will check for a blocked urinary catheter and signs of constipation which may cause AD in someone with a spinal cord injury. If a slowing of the heart rate is causing AD, drugs called anticholinergics (such as atropine) may be used. Very high blood pressure needs to be treated quickly but carefully, because the blood pressure can drop suddenly. A pacemaker may be needed for an unstable heart rhythm. Outlook (Prognosis) Outlook depends on the cause. People with AD due to a medicine usually recover when that medicine is stopped. When AD is caused by other factors, recovery depends on how well the disease can be treated. Possible Complications Complications may occur due to side effects of medicines used to treat the condition. Long-term, severe high blood pressure may cause seizures, bleeding in the eyes, stroke, or death. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider right away if you have symptoms of AD. Prevention To prevent AD, do not take medicines that cause this condition or make it worse. In people with spinal cord injury, the following may also help prevent AD: Do not let the bladder become too full Pain should be controlled Practice proper bowel care to avoid stool impaction Practice proper skin care to avoid bedsores and skin infections Prevent bladder infections Alternative Names Autonomic hyperreflexia; Spinal cord injury - autonomic dysreflexia; SCI - autonomic dysreflexia Images Central nervous system and peripheral nervous system References Cheshire WP.

Sleep normally occurs in several stages. The sleep cycle includes: Dreamless periods of light and deep sleep Some periods of active dreaming (REM sleep) The sleep cycle is repeated several times during the night. AGING CHANGES Sleep patterns tend to change as you age. Most people find that aging causes them to have a harder time falling asleep. They wake up more often during the night and earlier in the morning. Total sleep time stays the same or is slightly decreased (6.5 to 7 hours per night). It may be harder to fall asleep and you may spend more total time in bed. The transition between sleep and waking up is often abrupt, which makes older people feel like they are a lighter sleeper than when they were younger. Less time is spent in deep, dreamless sleep. Older people wake up an average of 3 or 4 times each night. They are also more aware of being awake. Older people wake up more often because they spend less time deep sleep. Other causes include needing to get up and urinate ( nocturia ), anxiety, and discomfort or pain from long-term (chronic) illnesses. EFFECT OF CHANGES Sleep difficulty is an annoying problem. Long-term (chronic) insomnia is a major cause of auto accidents and depression. Because older people sleep more lightly and wake up more often, they may feel deprived of sleep even when their total sleep time has not changed. Sleep deprivation can eventually cause confusion and other mental changes . It is treatable, though. You can reduce symptoms when you get enough sleep. Sleep problems are also a common symptom of depression. See a health care provider to find out whether depression or another health condition is affecting your sleep. COMMON PROBLEMS Insomnia is one of the more common sleep problems in older people. Other sleep disorders , such as restless legs syndrome, narcolepsy , or hypersomnia can also occur. Sleep apnea , a condition where breathing stops for a time during sleep, can cause severe problems. PREVENTION Older people respond differently to medicines than do younger adults. It is very important to talk with your provider before taking sleep medicines. If possible, avoid sleep medicines. However, antidepressant medicines can be very helpful if depression affects your sleep. Some antidepressants do not cause the same side effects as sleep medicines. Sometimes, a mild antihistamine works better than a sleeping pill for relieving short-term insomnia. However, most health experts do not recommend these types of medicines for older people. Use sleep medicines (such as zolpidem, zaleplon, eszoplicone or benzodiazepines) only as recommended, and only for a short time. Some of these medicines can lead to dependence (needing to take the drug to function) or addiction (compulsive use despite adverse consequences). Some of these drugs build up in your body. You can develop toxic effects such as confusion, delirium , and falls if you take them for a long time. You can take measures to help you sleep: A light bedtime snack may be helpful. Many people find that warm milk increases sleepiness, because it contains a natural, sedative-like amino acid. Avoid stimulants such as caffeine (found in coffee, tea, cola drinks, and chocolate) for at least 3 or 4 hours before bed. Do not take naps during the day. Exercise at regular times each day, but not within 3 hours of your bedtime. Avoid too much stimulation, such as violent TV shows or computer games, before sleep. Practice relaxation techniques at bedtime. Do not watch television or use your computer, cell phone, or tablet in the bedroom. Try to go to bed at the same time every night and wake at the same time each morning. Use the bed only for sleep or sexual activity. Avoid tobacco products, especially before sleep. Ask your provider if any of the medicines you take may affect your sleep. If you cannot fall asleep after 20 minutes, get out of bed and do a quiet activity, such as reading or listening to music. When you feel sleepy, get back in bed and try again. If you still cannot fall asleep in 20 minutes, repeat the process. Drinking alcohol at bedtime may make you sleepy. However, it is best to avoid alcohol, because it can make you wake up later in the night.

Atopic dermatitis is a long-term (chronic) skin disorder that involves scaly and itchy rashes. It is a type of eczema. Other forms of eczema include: Contact dermatitis Dyshidrotic eczema Nummular eczema Seborrheic dermatitis Causes Atopic dermatitis is due to a reaction in the skin. The reaction leads to ongoing itching, swelling and redness. People with atopic dermatitis may be more sensitive because their skin lacks specific proteins that maintain the skin's barrier to water. Atopic dermatitis is most common in infants. It may start as early as age 2 to 6 months. Many people outgrow it by early adulthood. People with atopic dermatitis often have asthma or seasonal allergies. There is often a family history of allergies such as asthma, hay fever, or eczema. People with atopic dermatitis often test positive for allergy skin tests. However, atopic dermatitis is not caused by allergies. The following can make atopic dermatitis symptoms worse: Allergies to pollen, mold, dust mites, or animals Cold and dry air in the winter Colds or the flu Contact with irritants and chemicals Contact with rough materials, such as wool Dry skin Emotional stress Drying out of the skin from taking frequent baths or showers and swimming very often Getting too hot or too cold, as well as sudden changes in temperature Perfumes or dyes added to skin lotions or soaps Symptoms Skin changes may include: Blisters with oozing and crusting Dry skin all over the body, or areas of bumpy skin on the back of the arms and front of the thighs Ear discharge or bleeding Raw areas of the skin from scratching Skin color changes, such as more or less color than the normal skin tone Skin redness or inflammation around the blisters Thickened or leather-like areas, which can occur after long-term irritation and scratching The type and location of the rash can depend on the age of the person: In children younger than age 2, the rash may begin on the face, scalp, hands, and feet. The rash is often itchy and forms blisters that ooze and crust over. In older children and adults, the rash is more often seen on the inside of the knees and elbow. It can also appear on the neck, hands, and feet. In adults, the rash may be limited to the hands, eyelids, or genitals. Rashes may occur anywhere on the body during a bad outbreak. Intense itching is common. Itching may start even before the rash appears. Atopic dermatitis is often called the "itch that rashes" because the itching starts, and then the skin rash follows as a result of scratching. Exams and Tests Your health care provider will look at your skin and do a physical exam. You may need a skin biopsy to confirm the diagnosis or rule out other causes of dry, itchy skin. Diagnosis is based on: How your skin looks Your personal and family history Allergy skin testing may be helpful for people with: Hard-to-treat atopic dermatitis Other allergy symptoms Skin rashes that form only on certain areas of the body after exposure to a specific chemical Your provider may order cultures for infection of the skin. If you have atopic dermatitis, you may get infections easily. Treatment SKIN CARE AT HOME Daily skin care may cut down on the need for medicines. To help you avoid scratching your rash or skin: Use a moisturizer, topical steroid cream, or other medicine your provider prescribes. Take antihistamine medicines by mouth to reduce severe itching. Keep your fingernails cut short. Wear light gloves during sleep if nighttime scratching is a problem. Keep your skin moist by using ointments (such as petroleum jelly), creams, or lotions 2 to 3 times a day. Choose skin products that do not contain alcohol, scents, dyes, and other chemicals. A humidifier to keep home air moist will also help. Avoid things that make symptoms worse, such as: Foods, such as eggs, that may cause an allergic reaction in a very young child (always talk to your provider first) Irritants, such as wool and lanolin Strong soaps or detergents, as well as chemicals and solvents Sudden changes in body temperature and stress, which may cause sweating Triggers that cause allergy symptoms When washing or bathing: Expose your skin to water for as short a time as possible. Short, cooler baths are better than long, hot baths. Use gentle body washes and cleansers instead of regular soaps. Do not scrub or dry your skin too hard or for too long. Apply lubricating creams, lotions, or ointment to your skin while it is still damp after bathing. This will help trap moisture in your skin. MEDICINES At this time, allergy shots are not used to treat atopic dermatitis. Antihistamines taken by mouth may help with itching or allergies. You can often buy these medicines without a prescription. Atopic dermatitis is usually treated with medicines placed directly on the skin or scalp. These are called topical medicines: You will probably be prescribed a mild corticosteroid cream or ointment at first (such as hydrocortisone). You may need a stronger medicine if this does not work. Medicines called topical immunomodulators (TIMs) may be prescribed for anyone over 2 years old. Ask your provider about concerns over a possible cancer risk with the use of these medicines. Creams or ointments that contain coal tar or anthralin may be used for thickened areas. Barrier repair creams containing ceramides may be used. Wet-wrap treatment with topical corticosteroids may help control the condition. But, it may lead to an infection. Other treatments that may be used include: Antibiotic creams or pills if your skin is infected Drugs that suppress the immune system Targeted biologic medicines that are designed to affect parts of the immune system involved in atopic dermatitis Phototherapy, a treatment in which your skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light Short-term use of systemic steroids (steroids given by mouth or through a vein) Outlook (Prognosis) Atopic dermatitis lasts a long time. You can control it by treating it, avoiding irritants, and by keeping your skin well-moisturized. In children, the condition often starts to go away around age 5 to 6, but flare-ups will often occur. In adults, the problem is generally a long-term or returning condition. Atopic dermatitis may be harder to control if it: Begins at an early age Involves a large amount of the body Occurs along with allergies and asthma Occurs in someone with a family history of eczema Possible Complications Complications of atopic dermatitis include: Infections of the skin caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses Permanent scars Side effects from long-term use of medicines to control eczema When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if: Atopic dermatitis does not get better with home care Symptoms get worse or treatment does not work You have signs of infection (such as fever, redness, or pain) Prevention Children who are breastfed until age 4 months may be less likely to get atopic dermatitis. If a child is not breastfed, using a formula that contains processed cow milk protein (called partially hydrolyzed formula) may cut down on the chances of developing atopic dermatitis.

The endocrine system is made up of organs and tissues that produce hormones. Hormones are natural chemicals produced in one location, released into the bloodstream, and then used by other target organs and systems. Hormones control the target organs. Some organ systems have their own internal control systems along with, or instead of, hormones. As we age, changes naturally occur in the way body systems are controlled. Some target tissues become less sensitive to their controlling hormone. The amount of hormones produced may also change. Blood levels of some hormones increase, some decrease, and some are unchanged. Hormones are also broken down (metabolized) more slowly. Many of the organs that produce hormones are controlled by other hormones. Aging also changes this process. For example, an endocrine tissue may produce less of its hormone than it did at a younger age, or it may produce the same amount at a slower rate. AGING CHANGES The hypothalamus is located in the brain. It produces hormones that control the other structures in the endocrine system, including the pituitary gland. The amount of these regulating hormones stays about the same, but the response by the endocrine organs can change as we age. The pituitary gland is located just below (anterior pituitary) or in (posterior pituitary) the brain. This gland reaches its maximum size in middle age and then gradually becomes smaller. It has two parts: The back (posterior) part stores hormones produced in the hypothalamus. The front (anterior) part produces hormones that affect growth, the thyroid gland ( TSH ), adrenal cortex, ovaries, testes, and breasts. The thyroid gland is located in the neck. It produces hormones that help control metabolism . With aging, the thyroid may become lumpy (nodular). Metabolism slows over time, beginning at around age 20. Because thyroid hormones are produced and broken down (metabolized) at the same rate, thyroid function tests are most often still normal. In some people, thyroid hormone levels may rise, leading to an increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease. The parathyroid glands are four tiny glands located around the thyroid. Parathyroid hormone affects calcium and phosphate levels, which affect bone strength. Parathyroid hormone levels rise with age, which may contribute to osteoporosis . Insulin is produced by the pancreas. It helps sugar (glucose) go from the blood to the inside of cells, where it can be used for energy. The average fasting glucose level rises 6 to 14 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) every 10 years after age 50 as the cells become less sensitive to the effects of insulin. Once the level reaches 126 mg/dL or higher, the person is considered to have diabetes. The adrenal glands are located just above the kidneys. The adrenal cortex, the surface layer, produces the hormones aldosterone , cortisol, and dehydroepiandrosterone. Aldosterone regulates fluid and electrolyte balance. Cortisol is the "stress response" hormone. It affects the breakdown of glucose, protein, and fat, and it has anti-inflammatory and anti-allergy effects. Aldosterone release decreases with age. This decrease can contribute to lightheadedness and a drop in blood pressure with sudden position changes (orthostatic hypotension). Cortisol release also decreases with aging, but the blood level of this hormone stays about the same. Dehydroepiandrosterone levels also drop. The effects of this drop on the body are not clear. The ovaries and testes have two functions. They produce the reproductive cells (ova and sperm). They also produce the sex hormones that control secondary sex characteristics, such as breasts and facial hair. With aging, men often have a lower level of testosterone . Women have lower levels of estradiol and other estrogen hormones after menopause . EFFECT OF CHANGES Overall, some hormones decrease, some do not change, and some increase with age. Hormones that usually decrease include: Aldosterone Calcitonin Growth hormone Renin In women, estrogen and prolactin levels often decrease significantly. Hormones that most often remain unchanged or only slightly decrease include: Cortisol Epinephrine Insulin Thyroid hormones T3 and T4 Testosterone levels usually decrease gradually as men age. Hormones that may increase include: Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) Luteinizing hormone (LH) Norepinephrine Parathyroid hormone RELATED TOPICS Aging changes in immunity Aging changes in organs, tissues, and cells Aging changes in the male reproductive system Menopause Images Menopause Female reproductive anatomy References Bolignano D, Pisano A.

Abdominal pain is pain that you feel anywhere between your chest and groin. This is often referred to as the stomach region or belly. Considerations Almost everyone has pain in the abdomen at some point. Most of the time, it is not serious. How bad your pain is does not always reflect the seriousness of the condition causing the pain. For example, you might have very bad abdominal pain if you have gas or stomach cramps due to viral gastroenteritis . However, potentially fatal conditions, such as colon cancer or early appendicitis , may only cause mild pain or no pain. Other ways to describe pain in your abdomen include: Generalized pain -- This means that you feel it in more than half of your belly. This type of pain is more typical for a stomach virus, indigestion, or gas. If the pain becomes more severe, it may be caused by a blockage of the intestines. Localized pain -- This is pain found in only one area of your belly. It is more likely to be a sign of a problem in an organ, such as the appendix, gallbladder, or stomach. Cramp-like pain -- This type of pain is not serious most of the time. It is likely to be due to gas and bloating, and is often followed by diarrhea. More worrisome signs include pain that occurs more often, lasts more than 24 hours, or occurs with a fever or rectal bleeding. Colicky pain -- This type of pain comes in waves. It very often starts and ends suddenly, and is often severe. Kidney stones and gallstones are common causes of this type of belly pain. Causes Many different conditions can cause abdominal pain. The key is to know when you need to get medical care right away. Sometimes, you may only need to contact a health care provider if your symptoms continue. Less serious causes of abdominal pain include: Constipation Irritable bowel syndrome Food allergies or intolerance (such as lactose intolerance ) Food poisoning Stomach flu Other possible causes include: Appendicitis Abdominal aortic aneurysm (bulging and weakening of the major artery in the body) Bowel blockage or obstruction Cancer of the stomach, colon (large bowel), and other organs Cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) with or without gallstones Decreased blood supply to the intestines ( ischemic bowel ) Diverticulitis (inflammation and infection of the colon) Endometriosis Heartburn , indigestion , or gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) Hernia in which the intestine is stuck or twisted Inflammatory bowel disease ( Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis ) Kidney stones Muscle strain Pancreatitis (swelling or infection of the pancreas) Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Ruptured ovarian cyst Severe menstrual cramps Tubal ( ectopic ) pregnancy Ulcers Urinary tract infections (UTI) Home Care You can try the following home care steps to ease mild abdominal pain: Sip water or other clear fluids. You may have sports drinks in small amounts. People with diabetes must check their blood sugar often and adjust their medicines as needed. Avoid solid food for the first few hours. If you have been vomiting, wait 6 hours, and then eat small amounts of mild foods such as rice, applesauce, or crackers. Avoid dairy products. If the pain is high up in your abdomen and occurs after meals, antacids may help, especially if you feel heartburn or indigestion. Avoid citrus, high-fat foods, fried or greasy foods, tomato products, caffeine, alcohol, and carbonated beverages. DO NOT take any medicine without talking to your provider. These additional steps may help prevent some types of abdominal pain: Drink plenty of water each day. Eat small meals more frequently. Exercise regularly. Limit foods that produce gas. Make sure that your meals are well-balanced and high in fiber. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. When to Contact a Medical Professional Get medical help right away or call 911 or the local emergency number if you: Are currently being treated for cancer Are unable to pass stool, especially if you are also vomiting Are vomiting blood or have blood in your stool (especially if bright red, maroon or dark, tarry black) Have chest, neck, or shoulder pain Have sudden, sharp abdominal pain Have pain in, or between, your shoulder blades with nausea Have tenderness in your belly, or your belly is rigid and hard to the touch Are pregnant or could be pregnant Had a recent injury to your abdomen Have difficulty breathing Contact your provider if you have: Abdominal discomfort that lasts 1 week or longer Abdominal pain that does not improve in 24 to 48 hours, or becomes more severe and frequent and occurs with nausea and vomiting Bloating that persists for more than 2 days Burning sensation when you urinate or frequent urination Diarrhea for more than 5 days Fever, over 100°F (37.7°C) for adults or 100.4°F (38°C) for children, with pain Prolonged poor appetite Prolonged vaginal bleeding Unexplained weight loss Unable to keep down any foods or liquids What to Expect at Your Office Visit Your provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms and medical history.

Atherosclerosis, sometimes called "hardening of the arteries," occurs when fat, cholesterol, and other substances build up in the walls of arteries. These deposits are called plaques. Over time, these plaques can narrow or completely block the arteries and cause problems throughout the body. Atherosclerosis is a common disorder. Causes Watch this video about: Atherosclerosis Atherosclerosis often occurs with aging. As you grow older, plaque buildup narrows your arteries and makes them stiffer. These changes make it harder for blood to flow through them. Clots may form in these narrowed arteries and block blood flow. Pieces of plaque can also break off and move to smaller blood vessels, blocking them. These blockages starve tissues of blood and oxygen. This can result in damage or tissue death. It is a common cause of heart attack and stroke. High blood cholesterol levels can cause hardening of the arteries at a younger age. For many people, high cholesterol levels are due to a diet that is too high in saturated fats and trans fats. Other factors that can contribute to hardening of the arteries include: Diabetes Family history of hardening of the arteries High blood pressure Lack of exercise Being overweight or obese Smoking Symptoms Atherosclerosis does not cause symptoms until blood flow to part of the body becomes slowed or blocked. If the arteries supplying the heart become narrow, blood flow can slow down or stop. This can cause chest pain (stable angina), shortness of breath, and other symptoms. Narrowed or blocked arteries may also cause problems in the intestines, kidneys, legs, and brain. Exams and Tests A health care provider will perform a physical exam and listen to the heart and lungs with a stethoscope. Atherosclerosis can create a whooshing or blowing sound ("bruit") over an artery. All people age 18 or older should have their blood pressure checked every year. More frequent measurement may be needed for those with a history of high blood pressure readings or those with risk factors for high blood pressure. Cholesterol testing is recommended in all adults. The major national guidelines differ on the suggested age to start testing. Screening should begin between ages 20 to 35 for men and ages 20 to 45 for women. Repeat testing is not needed for five years for most adults with normal cholesterol levels. Repeat testing may be needed if lifestyle changes occur, such as large increase in weight or a change in diet. More frequent testing is needed for adults with a history of high cholesterol, diabetes, kidney problems, heart disease, stroke, and other conditions A number of imaging tests may be used to see how well blood moves through your arteries. Check with your provider to see if any of these are recommended for you. Doppler tests that use ultrasound or sound waves Magnetic resonance arteriography (MRA), a special type of MRI scan Special CT scans called CT angiography Arteriograms or angiography that use x-rays and contrast material (sometimes called "dye") to see the path of blood flow inside the arteries Treatment Lifestyle changes will reduce your risk for atherosclerosis. Things you can do include: Quit smoking : This is the single most important change you can make to reduce your risk for heart disease and stroke. Avoid fatty foods: Eat well-balanced meals that are low in fat and cholesterol. Include several daily servings of fruits and vegetables. Adding fish to your diet at least twice a week may be helpful. However, do not eat fried fish. Limit how much alcohol you drink: Recommended limits are one drink a day for women, two a day for men. Get regular physical activity: Exercise with moderate intensity (such as brisk walking) 5 days a week for 30 minutes a day if you are at a healthy weight. For weight loss, exercise for 60 to 90 minutes a day. Talk to your provider before starting a new exercise plan, especially if you have been diagnosed with heart disease or you have ever had a heart attack. If your blood pressure is high, it is important for you to lower it and keep it under control. The goal of treatment is to reduce your blood pressure so that you have a lower risk of health problems caused by high blood pressure. You and your provider should set a blood pressure goal for you. Do not stop or change high blood pressure medicines without talking to your provider. Your provider may want you to take medicine for abnormal cholesterol levels or for high blood pressure if lifestyle changes do not get you to your goals for these. This will depend on: Your age The medicines you take Your risk of side effects from possible medicines Whether you have heart disease or other blood flow problems Whether you smoke or are overweight Whether you have diabetes or other heart disease risk factors Whether you have any other medical problems, such as kidney disease Your provider may suggest taking aspirin or another medicine to help prevent blood clots from forming in your arteries. These medicines are called antiplatelet drugs. DO NOT take aspirin without first talking to your provider. Losing weight if you are overweight and reducing blood sugar if you have diabetes or pre-diabetes can help reduce the risk of developing atherosclerosis. Outlook (Prognosis) Atherosclerosis cannot be reversed once it has occurred. However, lifestyle changes and treating high cholesterol levels can prevent or slow the process from becoming worse. This can help reduce the chances of having a heart attack and stroke as a result of atherosclerosis. Possible Complications In some cases, the plaque is part of a process that causes a weakening of the wall of an artery. This can lead to a bulge in an artery called an aneurysm . Aneurysms can break open (rupture). This causes bleeding that can be life threatening.

Acute coronary syndrome is a term for a group of conditions that suddenly stop or severely reduce blood from flowing to the heart muscle. When blood cannot flow to the heart muscle, the heart muscle can become damaged. Heart attack and unstable angina are both acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Causes A fatty substance called plaque can build up in the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your heart. Plaque is made up of cholesterol, fat, cells, and other substances. Plaque can block blood flow in two ways: It can cause an artery to become so narrow over time that it becomes blocked enough to cause symptoms. The plaque tears suddenly and a blood clot forms around it, severely narrowing or blocking the artery. Many risk factors for heart disease may lead to an ACS. Symptoms The most common symptom of ACS is chest pain. The chest pain may come on quickly, come and go, or get worse with exercise or rest. Other symptoms can include: Pain in the shoulder, arm, neck, jaw, back, or belly area Discomfort that feels like tightness, squeezing, crushing, burning, choking, or aching Discomfort that occurs at rest and does not easily go away when you take medicine Shortness of breath Anxiety Nausea Sweating Feeling dizzy or lightheaded Fast or irregular heartbeat Women and older people often experience these other symptoms, although chest pain is common for them as well. Exams and Tests Your health care provider will do an exam, listen to your chest with a stethoscope, and ask about your medical history. Tests for ACS include: Electrocardiogram (ECG) -- An ECG is usually the first test your doctor will run. It measures your heart's electrical activity. During the test, you will have small pads taped to your chest and other areas of your body. Blood test -- Some blood tests help show the cause of chest pain and see if you are at a high risk for a heart attack. A troponin blood test can show if the cells in your heart have been damaged. This test can confirm you are having a heart attack. Echocardiogram -- This test uses sound waves to look at your heart. It shows if your heart has been damaged and can find some types of heart problems. Coronary angiography may be done right away or when you are more stable. This test: Uses a special dye and x-rays to see how blood flows through your heart Can help your provider decide which treatments you need next Other tests to look at your heart that may be done while you are in the hospital include: Exercise stress test Nuclear stress test Stress echocardiography Treatment Your provider may use medicines, surgery, or other procedures to treat your symptoms and restore blood flow to your heart. Your treatment depends on your condition and the amount of blockage in your arteries. Your treatment may include: Medicine -- Your provider may give you one or more types of medicine, including aspirin, beta blockers, statins, blood thinners, clot dissolving drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or nitroglycerin. These medicines may help prevent or break up a blood clot, treat high blood pressure or angina, relieve chest pain, and stabilize your heart. Angioplasty -- This procedure opens the clogged artery using a long, thin tube called a catheter. The tube is placed in the artery and the provider inserts a small deflated balloon. The balloon is inflated inside the artery to open it up. Your doctor may insert a wire tube, called a stent, to keep the artery open. Bypass surgery -- This is surgery to route the blood around the artery that is blocked. Outlook (Prognosis) How well you do after an ACS depends on: How quickly you get treated The number of arteries that are blocked and how bad the blockage is Whether or not your heart has been damaged, as well as the extent and location of the damage, and where the damage is In general, the quicker your artery gets unblocked, the less damage you will have to your heart. People tend to do best when the blocked artery is opened within a few hours from the time symptoms start. Possible Complications In some cases, ACS can lead to other health problems including: Abnormal heart rhythms Death Heart attack Heart failure, which happens when the heart cannot pump enough blood Rupture of part of the heart muscle causing tamponade or severe valve leakage Stroke When to Contact a Medical Professional An ACS is a medical emergency. If you have symptoms, call 911 or the local emergency number quickly. Do not: Try to drive yourself to the hospital. Wait - If you are having a heart attack, you are at greatest risk for sudden death in the early hours. Prevention There is a lot you can do to help prevent ACS. Eat a heart-healthy diet . Have plenty of fruits, veggies, whole grains, and lean meats. Try to limit foods high in cholesterol and saturated fats, since too much of these substances can clog your arteries. Get exercise. Aim to get at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. Lose weight, if you are overweight. Quit smoking. Smoking can damage your heart. Ask your doctor if you need help quitting. Get preventive health screenings. You should see your doctor for regular cholesterol and blood pressure tests and learn how to keep your numbers in check. Manage health conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes.

Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is when a person who has one X and one Y chromosome (typically seen in males) is resistant to hormones that produce a male appearance (called androgens). As a result, the person has some of the physical traits of a female, but the genetic makeup of a male. Androgen insensitivity syndrome is one of the conditions that are described as differences of sex development (DSD). Causes In the first 2 to 3 months of pregnancy, all babies have the same genitals. As a baby grows inside the womb, male or female genitals develop depending on the sex chromosomes the baby has from the parents (XY for male, XX for female). It also depends on the levels of androgens. In a baby with XY chromosomes, high levels of androgens are made in the testes. This baby will develop male genitals. In a baby with XX chromosomes, there are no testes and the levels of androgens are very low. This baby will develop female genitals. AIS is caused by genetic defects on the X chromosome. These defects make the body unable to respond to the hormones that produce a male appearance. The syndrome is divided into three main categories: Complete AIS (CAIS) Partial AIS ( PAIS ) Mild AIS (MAIS) In CAIS: The body does not respond to androgen at all. The penis and other male body parts fail to develop. The child appears female at birth. In PAIS: The body only partly responds to androgen. Infants with PAIS may have male traits, female traits, or both. In MAIS: In this mild form, the body only partly responds to androgen. Infants with MAIS will have male traits. The syndrome is passed down genetically ( X-linked recessive inheritance ). People with two X chromosomes are not affected if only one copy of the X chromosome carries the genetic variant. Males who inherit the gene from their mothers will have the condition. There is a 50% chance that a male child of a mother with the genetic trait will be affected. Every female child of a mother with the genetic trait has a 50% chance of carrying the genetic trait. Family history is important in determining risk factors of AIS. Symptoms A person with CAIS appears to be female but has no uterus, no fallopian tubes, or ovaries. They have very little armpit and pubic hair. At puberty, female sex characteristics (such as breasts) develop. However, the person does not menstruate or become fertile. People with PAIS may have both male and female physical characteristics ( ambiguous genitalia ). These characteristics vary from person to person. These may include: Inguinal hernia Male breast development at the time of puberty ( gynecomastia ) Testes in the abdomen or other unusual places in the body ( undescended testicles ) A very small penis (micropenis) The opening of the urethra is on the underside of the penis, not the tip ( hypospadias ) Scrotum that is split in two (bifid scrotum) A vagina but no cervix or uterus A short vagina A very large clitoris Partial closing of the labia Sexual dysfunction Infertility A person with MAIS has male genitals and may have: Breast development Little body hair A small penis Exams and Tests CAIS is rarely discovered during childhood. Sometimes, a growth is felt in the abdomen or groin that turns out to be a testicle when it is explored with surgery. Most people with this condition are not diagnosed until they do not get a menstrual period. PAIS is often discovered during childhood because the person may have both male and female physical traits. Tests used to diagnose this condition may include: Blood tests to check levels of testosterone , luteinizing hormone (LH) , and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) Genetic testing ( karyotype ) to determine the person's genetic makeup Sperm count Testicular biopsy Pelvic ultrasound Other blood tests may be done to help tell the difference between AIS and androgen deficiency. Treatment In children with CAIS, testicles that are in the wrong place may not be removed until a child finishes growing and goes through puberty. At this time, the testes may be removed because they can develop cancer, just like any undescended testicle. Estrogen replacement may be prescribed after puberty. Females with CAIS have a shortened vagina. They may choose to use vaginal dilation to lengthen it. Infants with PAIS may be assigned a gender depending on the extent of genital ambiguity. However, gender assignment is a complex issue, and the need for it and the timing of it must be considered carefully. PAIS can be distressing for parents and families. While early surgery may make the parents feel more comfortable, the child may not be happy with the decision as they become older. Many health experts and intersex advocates suggest waiting until the child is old enough to be involved in the decision, unless surgery is needed for the health of the infant. Possible treatments for PAIS include: Surgery may be done to reduce breasts, repair undescended testicles, or reshape the penis to provide a more male appearance. They may also receive androgens to help facial hair grow and deepen the voice. Surgery may be done to remove the testicles and reshape the genitals to provide a more female appearance. The female hormone estrogen is then given during puberty. Treatment and gender assignment can be a very complex issue and must be targeted to each individual person. Treatment guidelines are still evolving. It is vital that children with AIS and their parents receive care and support from a health care team that includes different specialists with expertise in gender medicine. This should include mental health professionals to help provide support for both children and their parents. Support Groups More information and support for people with AIS and their families can be found at: Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth -- interactadvocates.org Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center -- rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/5803/androgen-insensitivity-syndrome/living Outlook (Prognosis) Androgens are most important during early development in the womb. People with AIS can have a normal lifespan and be totally healthy, but they may have difficulty conceiving a child. Possible Complications Complications include: Infertility Psychological and social issues Testicular cancer When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your health care provider if you or your child has signs or symptoms of the syndrome. Genetic testing and counseling are recommended if AIS is suspected.

Anticoagulant rodenticides are poisons used to kill rats. Rodenticide means rodent killer. An anticoagulant is a blood thinner. Anticoagulant rodenticide poisoning occurs when someone swallows a product containing these chemicals. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. Poisonous Ingredient Poisonous ingredients include: 2-isovaleryl-1,3-indandione 2-pivaloyl-1,3-indandione Brodifacoum Chlorophacinone Coumachlor Difenacoum Diphacinone Warfarin Note: This list may not be all-inclusive. Where Found These ingredients may be found in: D-Con Mouse Prufe II, Talon (brodifacoum) Ramik, Diphacin (diphacinone) Note: This list may not be all-inclusive. Symptoms Symptoms include: Blood in the urine Bloody stools Bruising and bleeding under the skin Confusion, lethargy, or altered mental status from bleeding in the brain Low blood pressure Nosebleed Pale skin Shock Vomiting blood Home Care DO NOT make a person throw up unless told to do so by poison control or a health care professional. Before Calling Emergency Determine the following information: Person's age, weight, and condition The name of the product (ingredients and strengths, if known) Time it was swallowed How much was swallowed Poison Control Your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible. What to Expect at the Emergency Room The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Blood and urine tests will be done. The person may receive: Airway and breathing support, including oxygen. In extreme cases, a tube may be passed through the mouth into the lungs to prevent the person from breathing in blood. A breathing machine (ventilator) would then be needed. Blood transfusion, including clotting factors (which help your blood clot), and red blood cells. Chest x-ray . ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing) . Endoscopy -- a camera down the throat to see the esophagus and stomach. Fluids through a vein (IV). Medicines to treat symptoms. Medicine (activated charcoal) to absorb any remaining poison (activated charcoal may be given only if it can be done safely within one hour of poison ingestion). Laxatives to move the poison through the body more quickly. Medicine (antidote) such as vitamin K to reverse the effect of the poison. Outlook (Prognosis) Death may occur as late as 2 weeks after the poisoning as a result of bleeding. However, getting the right treatment most often prevents serious complications. If blood loss has damaged the heart or other vital organs, recovery may take longer. The person may not fully recover in these cases.

The ACE test measures the level of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the blood. How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed . How to Prepare for the Test Follow your health care provider's instructions for not eating or drinking for up to 12 hours before the test. If you are on steroid medicine, ask your provider if you need to stop the medicine before the test, because steroids can decrease ACE levels. Do not stop any medicine before talking to your provider. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed This test is most often ordered to help diagnose and monitor a disorder called sarcoidosis . People with sarcoidosis may have their ACE level tested regularly to check how severe the disease is and how well treatment is working. This test may also help confirm a diagnosis of Gaucher disease . Normal Results Normal values vary based on your age and the test method used. Adults have an ACE level less than 40 micrograms per liter. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean Higher than normal ACE level may be a sign of sarcoidosis. ACE levels may rise or fall as sarcoidosis worsens or improves. A higher than normal ACE level may also be seen in several other diseases and disorders, including: Adrenal glands do not make enough hormones ( Addison disease ) Cancer of the lymph tissue ( Hodgkin disease ) Diabetes Liver swelling and inflammation ( hepatitis ) due to alcohol use Lung disease such as asthma , cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , or tuberculosis Kidney disorder called nephrotic syndrome Multiple sclerosis Overactive thyroid ( hyperthyroidism ) Overactive parathyroid glands ( hyperparathyroidism ) Stomach ulcer Lower than normal ACE level may indicate: Chronic liver disease Chronic kidney failure Eating disorder called anorexia nervosa Steroid therapy (usually prednisone) Therapy for sarcoidosis Underactive thyroid ( hypothyroidism ) Risks There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Multiple punctures to locate veins Alternative Names Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme; SACE Images Blood test References Pincus MR, Carty RP.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a condition in which the body does not make enough of AAT, a protein that protects the lungs and liver from damage. The condition can lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and liver disease ( cirrhosis ). Causes AAT is a type of protein called a protease inhibitor. AAT is made in the liver and it works to protect the lungs and liver. AAT deficiency means there is not enough of this protein in the body. It is caused by a genetic defect. The condition is most common among Europeans and North Americans of European descent. Adults with severe AAT deficiency will develop emphysema, sometimes before 40 years of age. Smoking can increase the risk for emphysema and make it occur earlier. Symptoms Symptoms may include any of the following: Shortness of breath with and without exertion, and other symptoms of COPD Symptoms of liver failure Loss of weight without trying Wheezing Coughing Exams and Tests A physical examination may reveal a barrel-shaped chest, wheezing, or decreased breath sounds. The following tests may also help with diagnosis: AAT blood test Arterial blood gases Chest x-ray CT scan of the chest Genetic testing Lung function tests Your health care provider may suspect you of having this condition if you develop: COPD before age 45 COPD but you have never smoked or been exposed to toxins COPD and you have a family history of the condition Cirrhosis and no other cause can be found Cirrhosis and you have a family history of liver disease Treatment Treatment for AAT deficiency involves replacing the missing AAT protein. The protein is given through a vein each week or every 4 weeks. This is only slightly effective at preventing more lung damage in people without end-stage disease. This procedure is called augmentation therapy. If you smoke, you need to quit. Other treatments are also used for COPD and cirrhosis. Lung transplant can be used for severe lung disease, and liver transplant can be used for severe cirrhosis. Outlook (Prognosis) Some people with this deficiency will not develop liver or lung disease. If you quit smoking, you can slow the progression of the lung disease. COPD and cirrhosis can be life threatening. Possible Complications Complications of AAT deficiency include: Bronchiectasis (damage of the large airways) COPD Liver failure or cancer When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you develop symptoms of AAT deficiency.

Acromegaly is a condition in which there is too much growth hormone (GH) in your body. Causes Acromegaly is a rare condition. It is caused when the pituitary gland makes too much GH. The pituitary gland is a small endocrine gland attached to the bottom of the brain. It controls, makes, and releases several hormones, including GH. Usually, a noncancerous (benign) tumor of the pituitary gland releases too much GH. In rare cases, pituitary tumors can be inherited. In children, too much GH causes gigantism rather than acromegaly. Symptoms Symptoms of acromegaly may include any of the following: Body odor Blood in the stool Carpal tunnel syndrome Decreased muscle strength ( weakness ) Decreased peripheral vision Dental problems, gaps between the teeth Easy fatigue Enlarged tongue Excessive height (when excess GH production begins in childhood) Excessive sweating Headache Heart enlargement, which can cause fainting or shortness of breath Hoarseness Jaw pain Joint pain , limited joint movement, swelling of the bony areas around a joint Large bones of the face, large jaw and tongue, widely spaced teeth Large feet (change in shoe size), large hands (change in ring or glove size) Large glands in the skin (sebaceous glands) causing oily skin, thickening of the skin, skin tags (growths) Sleep apnea Widened fingers or toes, with swelling, redness, and pain Other symptoms that may occur with this disease: Colon polyps Excess hair growth in females ( hirsutism ) High blood pressure Type 2 diabetes Thyroid enlargement Weight gain Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. The following tests may be ordered to confirm the diagnosis of acromegaly and check for complications: Blood glucose Growth hormone Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) Prolactin Spine x-ray MRI of the brain , including the pituitary gland Echocardiogram Colonoscopy Sleep study Other tests may be ordered to check whether the rest of the pituitary gland is working normally. Often a GH suppression test is needed. This involves drawing blood from a vein 4 or 5 times over 2 hours before and after drinking a specific amount of a sugar solution. Glucose and GH are measured in the blood. Treatment Surgery to remove the pituitary tumor that is causing this condition often corrects the abnormal GH. Sometimes, the tumor is too large to be removed completely and acromegaly is not cured. In this case, medicines and radiation (radiotherapy) may be used to treat acromegaly. Some people with tumors that are too complicated to remove by surgery are treated with medicines instead of surgery. These medicines may block the production of GH from the pituitary gland or prevent the action of GH in other parts of the body. After treatment, you will need to see your provider regularly to make sure that the pituitary gland is working normally and that acromegaly does not come back. Yearly evaluations are usually recommended. Support Groups More information and support for people with acromegaly and their families can be found at: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases -- www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/endocrine-diseases/acromegaly National Organization for Rare Disorders -- rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/acromegaly/ Outlook (Prognosis) Pituitary surgery is successful in most people, depending on the size of the tumor and the experience of the neurosurgeon with pituitary tumors. Without treatment, the symptoms will get worse. Conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease may result. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if: You have symptoms of acromegaly Your symptoms do not improve with treatment Prevention Acromegaly cannot be prevented. Early treatment may prevent the disease from getting worse and help to avoid complications.

Aspergillosis is an infection or allergic response due to the aspergillus fungus. Causes Aspergillosis is caused by a fungus called aspergillus. The fungus is often found growing on dead leaves, stored grain, compost piles, or in other decaying vegetation. It can also be found on marijuana leaves. Although most people are often exposed to aspergillus, infections caused by the fungus rarely occur in people who have a healthy immune system. There are several forms of aspergillosis: Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is an allergic reaction to the fungus. This infection usually develops in people who already have lung problems such as asthma or cystic fibrosis. Aspergilloma is a growth (fungus ball) that develops in an area of past lung disease or lung scarring such as tuberculosis or lung abscess. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a serious infection with pneumonia. It can spread to other parts of the body. This infection occurs most often in people with a weakened immune system. This can be from cancer, AIDS, leukemia, an organ transplant, chemotherapy, or other conditions or medicines that lower the number or function of white blood cells or weaken the immune system. Symptoms Symptoms depend on the type of infection. Symptoms of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis may include: Cough Coughing up blood or brownish mucus plugs Fever General ill feeling (malaise) Wheezing Weight loss Other symptoms depend on the part of the body affected, and may include: Bone pain Chest pain Chills Decreased urine output Headaches Increased phlegm production, which may be bloody Shortness of breath Skin sores (lesions) Vision problems Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about the symptoms. Tests to diagnose aspergillus infection include: Aspergillus antibody test Chest x-ray Complete blood count CT scan Galactomannan (a sugar molecule shed from the fungus that is sometimes found in the blood) Immunoglobulin E (IgE) blood level Lung function tests Sputum stain and culture for fungus (looking for aspergillus) Tissue biopsy Treatment A fungus ball is usually not treated with antifungal medicines unless there is bleeding into the lung tissue. In such a case, surgery and medicines are needed. Invasive aspergillosis is treated with several weeks of an antifungal medicine. It can be given by mouth or IV (into a vein). Endocarditis caused by aspergillus is treated by surgically replacing the infected heart valves. Long-term antifungal medicines are also needed. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is treated with medicines that suppress the immune system (immunosuppressive medicines), such as prednisone, typically in conjunction with antifungals. Outlook (Prognosis) With treatment, people with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis usually get better over time. It is common for the disease to come back (relapse) and need repeat treatment. If invasive aspergillosis does not get better with treatment using medicine, it eventually leads to death. The outlook for invasive aspergillosis also depends on the person's underlying disease and immune system health. Possible Complications Health problems from the disease or treatment include: Amphotericin B can cause kidney damage and unpleasant side effects such as fever and chills Bronchiectasis (permanent scarring and enlargement of the small sacs in the lungs) Invasive lung disease can cause massive bleeding from the lung Mucus plugs in the airways Permanent airway blockage Respiratory failure When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you develop symptoms of aspergillosis or if you have a weakened immune system and develop a fever. Prevention Precautions should be taken when using medicines that suppress the immune system.

Appendicitis is a condition in which your appendix gets inflamed. The appendix is a small pouch attached to the end of the large intestine. Causes Appendicitis is a very common reason for emergency surgery. The problem most often occurs when the appendix becomes blocked by feces, a foreign object, a tumor or a parasite in rare cases. Symptoms The symptoms of appendicitis can vary. It can be hard to detect appendicitis in young children, older people, and women of childbearing age. The first symptom is often pain around the belly button or mid upper abdomen. Pain may be minor at first, but becomes more sharp and severe. You may also have a loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and a low-grade fever. The pain tends to move into the right lower part of your belly. The pain tends to focus at a spot directly above the appendix called McBurney point . This most often occurs 12 to 24 hours after the illness starts. Your pain may be worse when you walk, cough, or make sudden movements. Later symptoms include: Chills and shaking Hard stools Diarrhea Fever Nausea and vomiting Exams and Tests Your health care provider may suspect appendicitis based on the symptoms you describe. Your provider will do a physical exam. If you have appendicitis, your pain will increase when your lower right belly area is pressed. If your appendix has ruptured, touching the belly area may cause a lot of pain and lead you to tighten your muscles. A rectal exam may find tenderness on the right side of your rectum. A blood test will often show a high white blood cell count. Imaging tests that may help diagnose appendicitis include: CT scan of the abdomen Ultrasound of the abdomen Treatment Most of the time, a surgeon will remove your appendix as soon as you are diagnosed. If a CT scan shows that you have an abscess , you may be treated with antibiotics first. You will have your appendix removed after the infection and swelling have gone away. The tests used to diagnose appendicitis are not perfect. As a result, the operation may show that your appendix is normal. In that case, the surgeon will remove your appendix and explore the rest of your abdomen for other causes of your pain. Outlook (Prognosis) Most people recover quickly after surgery if the appendix is removed before it ruptures. If your appendix ruptures before surgery, recovery may take longer. You are also more likely to develop problems, such as: An abscess Blockage of the intestine Infection inside the abdomen (peritonitis) Infection of the wound after surgery When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have pain in the lower-right portion of your belly, or other symptoms of appendicitis.

Acid mucopolysaccharides is a test that measures the amount of mucopolysaccharides released into the urine either during one episode or over a 24-hour period. Mucopolysaccharides are long chains of sugar molecules in the body. They are often found in mucus and in fluid around the joints. How the Test is Performed For the 24-hour test, you must urinate into a special bag or container every time you use the bathroom. Most often, you will be given two containers. You will urinate directly into the smaller special container and then transfer that urine into the other larger container. On day 1, urinate into the toilet when you wake up in the morning. After the first urination, urinate into the special container every time you use the bathroom for the next 24 hours. Transfer the urine into the larger container and keep the larger container in a cool place or in a refrigerator. Keep this container tightly capped. On day 2, urinate into the container in the morning again when you wake up and transfer this urine to the larger container. Label the larger container with your name, the date, the time of completion, and return it as instructed. For an infant: Thoroughly wash the area around the urethra (the hole where urine flows out). Open a urine collection bag (a plastic bag with an adhesive paper on one end). For males, place the entire penis in the bag and attach the adhesive paper to the skin. For females, place the bag over the two folds of skin on either side of the vagina (labia). Put a diaper on the baby (over the bag). Check the infant often, and change the bag after the infant has urinated. Empty the urine from the bag into the container provided by your health care provider. Active babies can move the bag, causing the urine to go into the diaper. You may need extra collection bags. When finished, label the container and return it as you have been told. How to Prepare for the Test There is no special preparation needed. How the Test will Feel The test involves only normal urination, and there is no discomfort. Why the Test is Performed This test is done to diagnose a rare group of genetic disorders called mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS). These include, Hurler, Scheie, and Hurler/Scheie syndromes (MPS I), Hunter syndrome (MPS II), Sanfilippo syndrome (MPS III), Morquio syndrome (MPS IV), Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome (MPS VI), and Sly syndrome (MPS VII). Most of the time, this test is done in infants who may have a symptom or family history of one of these disorders. Normal Results Normal levels vary with age and from lab to lab. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean Abnormally high levels could indicate a type of mucopolysaccharidosis. Further tests are needed to determine the specific type of mucopolysaccharidosis.

Antisocial personality disorder is a mental condition in which a person has a long-term pattern of manipulating, exploiting, or violating the rights of others without any remorse. This behavior may cause problems in relationships or at work and is often criminal. Causes The cause of this disorder is unknown. A person's genes and other factors, such as child abuse, may contribute to developing this condition. People with an antisocial or alcoholic parent are at increased risk. Far more men than women are affected. The condition is common among people who are in prison. Setting fires and animal cruelty during childhood are often seen in the development of antisocial personality. Some doctors believe that psychopathic personality (psychopathy) is the same disorder. Others believe that psychopathic personality is a similar, but a more severe disorder. Symptoms A person with antisocial personality disorder may: Be able to act witty and charming Be good at flattery and manipulating other people's emotions Break the law repeatedly Disregard the safety of self and others Have problems with substance abuse Lie, steal, and fight often Not show guilt or remorse Often be angry or arrogant Exams and Tests Antisocial personality disorder is diagnosed based on a psychological evaluation. The health care provider will consider how long-lived and how severe the person's symptoms are. To be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, a person must have had emotional and behavioral problems ( conduct disorder ) during childhood. Treatment Antisocial personality disorder is one of the hardest personality disorders to treat. People with this condition usually don't seek treatment on their own. They may only start therapy when required to by a court. Behavioral treatments, such as those that reward appropriate behavior and have negative consequences for illegal behavior, may work in some people. Talk therapy may also help. People with an antisocial personality who have other disorders, such as a mood or substance use disorder, are often treated for those problems as well. Outlook (Prognosis) Symptoms tend to peak during the late teenage years and early 20s. They sometimes improve on their own by the time a person is in their 40s. Possible Complications Complications may include imprisonment, drug use , alcohol use, violence, and suicide. When to Contact a Medical Professional See a provider or a mental health professional if you or someone you know has symptoms of antisocial personality disorder. If you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org . You can also call 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides free and confidential support 24/7, anytime day or night. You can also call 911 or the local emergency number or go to the hospital emergency room. DO NOT delay. If someone you know has attempted suicide, call 911 or the local emergency number right away. DO NOT leave the person alone, even after you have called for help. Always take suicide attempts and threats seriously. Alternative Names Sociopathic personality; Sociopathy; Personality disorder - antisocial References American Psychiatric Association.

Anoscopy is a method to look at the: Anus Anal canal Lower rectum How the Test is Performed The procedure is usually done in a health care provider's office. A digital anorectal examination (DARE) is done first. Then, a lubricated instrument called an anoscope is placed a few inches or centimeters into the rectum. You will feel some discomfort when this is done. The anoscope has a light on the end, so your health care provider can see the entire area. High-resolution anoscopy (HRA) uses an additional magnifying device called a colposcope. This device allows for a closer examination of the tissues to detect small changes. HRA may be used to help detect abnormal cells in your anal lining. A sample for biopsy can be taken, if needed. How to Prepare for the Test Often, there is no preparation needed. Or, you may receive a laxative, enema, or other preparation to empty your bowel. You should empty your bladder before the procedure. Your provider may suggest that you avoid anal penetration and anal medicines or products before the procedure. How the Test will Feel There will be some discomfort during the procedure. You may feel the need to have a bowel movement. You may feel a pinch when a biopsy is taken. You can usually return to normal activities after the procedure. Why the Test is Performed This test may be used to determine whether you have: Anal fissures (small split or tear in the lining of the anus) Anal polyps (growth on the lining of the anus) Foreign object in the anus Hemorrhoids (swollen veins in the anus) Infection Inflammation Tumors Abnormal growth of cells (dysplasia) Anal cancer Anoscopy and HRA may also be used as a yearly screening test for anal cancer in people with HIV . Normal Results The anal canal appears normal in size, color, and tone. There is no sign of: Bleeding Polyps Hemorrhoids Other abnormal tissue What Abnormal Results Mean Abnormal results may include: Abscess (collection of pus in the anus) Fissures Foreign object in the anus Hemorrhoids Infection Inflammation Polyps (non-cancerous or cancerous) Tumors or dysplasia Risks There are few risks. If a biopsy is needed, there is a slight risk for bleeding and mild pain.

Aicardi syndrome is a rare disorder. In this condition, the structure that connects the two sides of the brain (called the corpus callosum) is partly or completely missing. Nearly all known cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family (sporadic). Causes The cause of Aicardi syndrome is unknown at this time. In some cases, experts believe it may be a result of a gene defect on the X chromosome . The disorder affects only girls. Symptoms Symptoms most often start when the child is between ages 3 and 5 months. The condition causes jerking (infantile spasms), a type of childhood seizure. Aicardi syndrome may occur with other brain defects. Other symptoms may include: Coloboma (cat's eye) Intellectual disability Smaller-than-normal eyes (microphthalmia) Exams and Tests Children are diagnosed with Aicardi syndrome if they meet the following criteria: Corpus callosum that is partly or completely missing Female sex Seizures (typically beginning as infantile spasms) Sores on the retina (retinal lesions) or optic nerve In rare cases, one of these features may be missing (especially lack of development of the corpus callosum). Tests to diagnose Aicardi syndrome include: CT scan of the head EEG Eye exam MRI Other procedures and tests may be done, depending on the person. Treatment Treatment is done to help prevent symptoms. It involves managing seizures and any other health concerns. Treatment uses programs to help the family and child cope with delays in development. Support Groups Aicardi Syndrome Foundation -- aicardisyndromefoundation.org/ National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) -- rarediseases.org Outlook (Prognosis) The outlook depends on how severe the symptoms are and what other health conditions are present. Nearly all children with this syndrome have severe learning difficulties and remain completely dependent on others. However, a few have some language abilities and some can walk on their own or with support. Vision varies from normal to blind. Possible Complications Complications depend on the severity of symptoms. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your health care provider if your child has symptoms of Aicardi syndrome.

Antithrombin III (AT III) is a protein that helps control blood clotting. A blood test can determine the amount of AT III present in your body. How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed . How to Prepare for the Test Certain medicines may affect the results of the test. Your health care provider may tell you to stop taking certain medicines or reduce their dose before the test. Do not stop taking any medicine before speaking with your provider. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed Your provider may order this test if you have repeated blood clots or if blood thinning medicine does not work. Normal Results Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean Lower-than-normal AT III may mean you have an increased risk for blood clotting. This can occur when there is not enough AT III in your blood, or when there is enough AT III in your blood, but the AT III does not function properly and is less active. Abnormal results may not appear until you are an adult. Examples of complications associated with increased blood clotting are: Deep venous thrombosis Phlebitis (vein inflammation) Pulmonary embolus (blood clot traveling to lung) Thrombophlebitis (vein inflammation with clot formation) Lower than normal AT III may be due to: Bone marrow transplant Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) AT III deficiency, an inherited condition Liver cirrhosis Nephrotic syndrome Higher than normal AT III may be due to: Use of anabolic steroids Bleeding disorder ( hemophilia ) Kidney transplant Low level of vitamin K Risks There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Multiple punctures to locate veins Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names Antithrombin; AT III; AT 3; Functional antithrombin III; Clotting disorder - AT III; DVT - AT III; Deep vein thrombosis - AT III References Anderson JA, Kogg KE, Weitz JI.

An absence seizure is the term for a type of seizure involving staring spells. This type of seizure is a brief (usually less than 15 seconds) change in awareness due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Causes Seizures result from overactivity in the brain. Absence seizures occur most often in people under age 20, usually in children ages 4 to 12 years. In some cases, the seizures are triggered by flashing lights or when the person breathes faster and more deeply than usual (hyperventilates). They may also occur with other types of seizures, such as bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal seizures), twitches or jerks ( myoclonus ), or sudden loss of muscle strength (atonic seizures). Symptoms Most absence seizures last only a few seconds. They often involve staring episodes. The episodes may: Occur many times a day Occur for weeks to months before being noticed Interfere with school and learning Be mistaken for lack of attention, daydreaming or other misbehavior Unexplained difficulties in school and learning difficulties may be the first sign of absence seizures. During the seizure, the person may: Stop walking and start again a few seconds later Stop talking in mid-sentence and start again a few seconds later The person usually does not fall during the seizure. Right after the seizure, the person is usually: Wide awake Thinking clearly Unaware of the seizure Specific symptoms of typical absence seizures may include: Changes in muscle activity, such as no movement, hand fumbling , fluttering eyelids, lip smacking, chewing Changes in alertness (consciousness) , such as staring episodes, lack of awareness of surroundings, sudden halt in movement, talking, and other awake activities Some absence seizures begin slower and last longer. These are called atypical absence seizures. Symptoms are similar to regular absence seizures, but muscle activity changes may be more noticeable. Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. This will include a detailed look at the brain and nervous system. An electroencephalogram (EEG) will be done to check the electrical activity in the brain. People with seizures often have abnormal electrical activity seen on this test. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures. Blood and urine tests may also be ordered to check for other health problems that may be causing the seizures. Head CT or MRI scan may be done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain. Treatment Treatment for absence seizures includes medicines, changes in lifestyle for adults and children , such as activity and diet, and sometimes surgery. Your provider can tell you more about these options.

Angiodysplasia of the colon (large intestine) is swollen, fragile blood vessels in the colon. These can result in bleeding and blood loss from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Angiodysplasia can also occur in the small intestine with similar causes and symptoms. Causes Angiodysplasia of the colon is mostly related to the aging and breakdown of the blood vessels. It is more common in older adults. It is almost always seen on the right side of the colon. Most likely, the problem develops due to normal movement of the colon that causes the blood vessels in the area to enlarge. When this swelling becomes severe, a tiny passageway develops between a small artery and vein. This is called an arteriovenous malformation. Bleeding can occur from this area in the colon wall. Other causes include certain heart and lung conditions. Rarely, angiodysplasia of the colon is related to other diseases of the blood vessels. One of these is Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. The condition is not related to cancer. It is also different from diverticulosis, which is a more common cause of intestinal bleeding in older adults. Symptoms The symptoms vary. Older people may have symptoms such as: Weakness Fatigue Shortness of breath due to anemia They may not have noticeable bleeding directly from the colon. Other people may have bouts of mild or severe bleeding in which bright red or black blood comes from the rectum. There is no pain associated with angiodysplasia. Exams and Tests Tests that may be done to diagnose this condition include: Angiography 01_003327(only useful if there is active bleeding into the colon). CT angiography (CTA). This is a special type of CT scan that shows active bleeding into the intestine. Complete blood count (CBC) to check for anemia. Colonoscopy. Stool test for occult (hidden) blood (a positive test result suggests bleeding from the colon). Treatment It is important to find the cause of bleeding in the colon and how fast the blood is being lost. You may need to be admitted to a hospital. Fluids may be given through a vein, and blood products may be required. Other treatment may be needed once the source of bleeding is found. In most cases, the bleeding stops on its own without treatment. If treatment is needed, it may involve: Angiography to help block the blood vessel that is bleeding or to deliver medicine to help cause the blood vessels to tighten to stop the bleeding. Burning (cauterizing) the site of the bleed with heat, argon plasma coagulation, or laser using a colonoscope. Medicines: A medicine called octreotide can be injected to help treat the problem. In some cases, surgery is the only option. You may need the entire right side of the colon (right hemicolectomy) removed if heavy bleeding continues, even after other treatments have been tried. Medicines (thalidomide) may rarely be used to help control the disease in some people. Outlook (Prognosis) People who have bleeding related to this condition despite having had colonoscopy, angiography, medicine, or surgery are likely to have more bleeding in the future. The outlook remains good if the bleeding is controlled. Possible Complications Complications may include: Anemia Death from excessive blood loss Side effects from treatment Severe loss of blood from the GI tract When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your health care provider if rectal bleeding occurs. Prevention There is no known prevention.

When it becomes swollen (inflamed) or infected, the condition is called appendicitis . When you have appendicitis, your appendix may need to be removed. An appendix that has a hole in it can leak and infect the entire abdomen area. This can be life threatening. Appendectomy is done using either: Spinal anesthesia -- Medicine is put into your lower back to make you numb below your waist. You will also get medicine to make you sleepy. General anesthesia -- You will be asleep and not feel any pain during the surgery. Your surgeon may make a small cut in the lower right side of your belly area and remove the appendix. Your appendix can also be removed using small surgical cuts and a camera. This is called a laparoscopic appendectomy. If your appendix broke open or a pocket of infection ( abscess ) formed, your abdomen may be washed out during surgery. A small tube may be left in the belly area to help drain out fluids or pus. Why the Procedure is Performed An appendectomy is done for appendicitis. The condition can be hard to diagnose, especially in children, older people, and women of childbearing age. Most often, the first symptom is pain around your belly button: The pain may be mild at first, but it becomes sharp and severe. The pain often moves into your right lower abdomen and becomes more focused in this area. Other symptoms include: Diarrhea or constipation Fever (usually not very high) Nausea and vomiting Reduced appetite If you have symptoms of appendicitis, seek medical help right away. Do not use heating pads, enemas, laxatives, or other home treatments to try to relieve symptoms. Your health care provider will examine your abdomen and may perform a rectal exam and pelvic exam. Other tests may be done: Blood tests, including a white blood cell (WBC) count , may be done to check for infection. Your provider may order a CT scan or ultrasound to determine if the appendix is the cause of the problem since other illnesses can cause the same or similar symptoms. The goal is to remove an infected appendix before it breaks open (ruptures). After reviewing your symptoms and the results of the physical exam and medical tests, your surgeon will decide whether you need surgery. Risks Risks of anesthesia and surgery in general include: Reactions to medicines Problems breathing Bleeding, blood clots, or infection Risks of an appendectomy after a ruptured appendix include: Buildup of pus (abscess), which may need draining and antibiotics Infection of the incision After the Procedure Most people leave the hospital in 1 to 2 days after surgery. You can go back to your normal activities within a few weeks after leaving the hospital though it may take several weeks to get back to your normal energy level. If you had laparoscopic surgery, you will likely recover quickly. Recovery is slower and more complicated if your appendix has broken open or an abscess has formed. Living without an appendix causes no known health problems.

Aarskog syndrome is a very rare disease that affects a person's height, muscles, skeleton, genitals, and appearance. It can be passed down through families (inherited). Causes Aarskog syndrome is a genetic disorder that is linked to the X chromosome. It affects mainly males, but females may have a milder form. The condition is caused by changes (mutations) in a gene called "faciogenital dysplasia" ( FGD1 ). Symptoms Symptoms of this condition include: Belly button that sticks out Bulge in the groin or scrotum Delayed sexual maturity Delayed teeth Downward palpebral slant to eyes (palpebral slant is the direction of the slant from the inner to outer corner of the eye) Hairline with a "widow's peak" Mildly sunken chest (pectus excavatum) Mild to moderate cognitive problems Mild to moderate short height , which may not be obvious until the child is 1 to 3 years old Poorly developed middle section of the face Rounded face Scrotum surrounds the penis (shawl scrotum) Short fingers and toes with mild webbing Single crease in the palm of the hand Small, broad hands and feet with short fingers and curved-in fifth finger Small nose with nostrils tipped forward Testicles that have not come down ( undescended ) Top portion of the ear folded over slightly Wide groove above the upper lip, crease below the lower lip Wide-set eyes with droopy eyelids Exams and Tests These tests may be done: Genetic testing for mutations in the FGD1 gene X-rays Treatment Moving the teeth may be done to treat some of the abnormal dental features a person with Aarskog syndrome may have. Support Groups More information and support for people with Aarskog syndrome and their families can be found at: National Organization for Rare Disorders -- rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/aarskog-syndrome NIH Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center -- rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/4775/aarskog-syndrome Outlook (Prognosis) Some people may have some mental slowness, but children with this condition often have good social skills. Some males may have problems with fertility. Possible Complications These complications can occur: Changes in the brain Difficulty growing in the first year of life Poorly aligned teeth Seizures Undescended testicles When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your health care provider if your child has delayed growth or if you notice any symptoms of Aarskog syndrome. Seek genetic counseling if you have a family history of Aarskog syndrome. Contact a genetic specialist if your provider thinks you or your child may have Aarskog syndrome. Prevention Genetic testing may be available for people with a family history of the condition or a known mutation of the gene that causes it.

Control medicines for asthma are medicines you take to control your asthma symptoms. You must use these medicines every day for them to work well. You and your health care provider can make a plan for the medicines that work for you. This plan will include when you should take them and how much you should take. You may need to take these medicines for at least a month before you start to feel the full effects. Take the medicines even when you feel OK. Take enough with you when you travel. Plan ahead. Make sure you do not run out. Inhaled Corticosteroids Inhaled corticosteroids prevent your airways from becoming inflamed in order to help keep your asthma symptoms away. Inhaled steroids are used with a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) and spacer. Or, they may be used with a dry powder inhaler. You should use an inhaled steroid every day as directed, even if you do not have symptoms. After you use it, rinse your mouth with water, gargle, and spit it out. If your child cannot use an inhaler, your provider may give you a medicine to use with a nebulizer . This machine turns liquid medicine into a spray so your child can breathe the medicine in. Long-acting Beta-agonist Inhalers These medicines relax the muscles of your airways to help keep your asthma symptoms away. Normally, you use these medicines only when you are using an inhaled steroid medicine and you still have symptoms. Do not take these long-acting medicines alone. Use this medicine every day as directed, even if you do not have symptoms. Combination Therapy Your provider may ask you to take both a steroid medicine and a long-acting beta-agonist medicine. It may be easier to use an inhaler that has both medicines in them. Another class of medicines called antimuscarinic agents may help some people with asthma. Check with your provider to see if this might help you. Leukotriene Modifiers These medicines are used to prevent asthma symptoms. They come in tablet or pill form and can be used together with a steroid inhaler. Cromolyn Cromolyn is a medicine that may prevent asthma symptoms. It can be used either in an inhaler or a nebulizer, so it may be easy for young children to take.

Abdominal bloating is a condition in which the belly (abdomen) feels full and tight. Your belly may look swollen (distended). Causes Common causes include: Swallowing air Constipation Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Irritable bowel syndrome Lactose intolerance and problems digesting other foods Overeating Small bowel bacterial overgrowth Weight gain You may have bloating if you take the oral diabetes medicine acarbose. Some other medicines or foods containing lactulose or sorbitol, may cause bloating. More serious disorders that may cause bloating are: Ascites and abdominal tumors Celiac disease Dumping syndrome Ovarian cancer Problems with the pancreas not producing enough digestive enzymes (pancreatic insufficiency) Home Care You may take the following steps: Avoid chewing gum or carbonated drinks. Stay away from foods with high levels of fructose or sorbitol. Avoid foods that can produce gas, such as Brussels sprouts, turnips, cabbage, beans, and lentils. Do not eat too quickly. Stop smoking. Get treatment for constipation if you have it. However, fiber supplements such as psyllium or 100% bran can make your symptoms worse. You may try simethicone and other medicines that you can buy at the drugstore to help with gas. Charcoal caps can also help. Watch for foods that trigger your bloating so you can start to avoid those foods. These may include: Milk and other dairy products that contain lactose Certain carbohydrates, including fructose (fruit sugar), that are fermentable and thus can produce gas. These carbohydrates are known as FODMAPs.

Aminoaciduria is an abnormally high amount of amino acids in the urine. Amino acids are the building blocks for proteins in the body. How the Test is Performed A clean-catch urine sample may be needed. This is often done at your health care provider's office or health clinic. How to Prepare for the Test Most of the time, you do not need to take special steps before this test. Make sure your provider knows all of the medicines you recently used. If this test is being done on an infant who is breastfeeding, make sure the provider knows what medicines the nursing mother is taking. How the Test will Feel The test involves only normal urination. Why the Test is Performed This test is done to measure amino acid levels in the urine. There are many different types of amino acids. It is common for some of each kind to be found in the urine. Increased levels of individual amino acids can be a sign of a problem with metabolism. Normal Results The specific value is measured in mmol/mol creatinine. The values below represent normal ranges in 24 hours urine for adults. Alanine: 9 to 98 Arginine: 0 to 8 Asparagine: 10 to 65 Aspartic acid : 5 to 50 Citrulline: 1 to 22 Cystine: 2 to 12 Glutamic acid: 0 to 21 Glutamine: 11 to 42 Glycine: 17 to 146 Histidine: 49 to 413 Isoleucine: 30 to 186 Leucine: 1 to 9 Lysine: 2 to 16 Methionine: 2 to 53 Ornithine: 1 to 5 Phenylalanine : 1 to 5 Proline: 3 to 13 Serine: 0 to 9 Taurine: 18 to 89 Threonine: 13 to 587 Tyrosine: 3 to 14 Valine: 3 to 36 Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.

Antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer is a blood test to measure antibodies against streptolysin O, a substance produced by group A streptococcus bacteria. Antibodies are proteins our bodies produce when they detect harmful substances, such as bacteria. How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed. How to Prepare for the Test DO NOT eat for 6 hours before the test. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, you may feel moderate pain, or only a prick. After the test, you may have some throbbing at the site. Why the Test is Performed You will need the test if you have symptoms of a previous infection by group A streptococcus. Some illnesses caused by these bacteria are: Bacterial endocarditis, an infection of the inner lining of your heart Guttate psoriasis A kidney problem called glomerulonephritis Rheumatic fever , which can affect the heart, joints, or bones Scarlet fever Strep throat The ASO antibody may be found in the blood weeks or months after the strep infection has gone away. Normal Results A negative test result means that you do not have strep infection. Your health care provider may do the test again in 2 to 4 weeks. At times, a test that was negative the first time may be positive (meaning it finds ASO antibodies) when done again. Normal value ranges may vary slightly. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your test results. What Abnormal Results Mean An abnormal or positive test result means you recently had a strep infection, even if you had no symptoms. Risks Veins and arteries vary in size from person to person, and from one side of the body to the other. Because of this, it may be harder to get a blood sample from some people than it is from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding where the needle is inserted Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names ASO titer; ASLO Images Blood test References Allen CT, Nussenbaum B, Merati AL.

Acute bronchitis is swelling and inflamed tissue in the bronchi, the main passages that carry air to the lungs. This swelling narrows the airways, which makes it harder to breathe. Other symptoms of bronchitis are a cough and coughing up mucus. Acute means the symptoms have been present only for a short time. Causes When acute bronchitis occurs, it almost always comes after having a cold or flu-like illness. The bronchitis infection is usually caused by a virus. At first, it affects your nose, sinuses, and throat. Then it spreads to the airways that lead to your lungs. Sometimes, bacteria also infect your airways. This is more common in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Chronic bronchitis is a long-term condition. To be diagnosed with chronic bronchitis, you must have a cough with mucus on most days for at least 3 months. Symptoms Some symptoms of acute bronchitis are: Chest discomfort Cough that produces mucus -- the mucus may be clear or yellow-green Fatigue Fever -- usually low-grade Shortness of breath that gets worse with activity Wheezing , in people with asthma Even after acute bronchitis has cleared, you may have a dry, nagging cough that lasts for 1 to 4 weeks. Sometimes it can be hard to know if you have pneumonia or bronchitis. If you have pneumonia, you are more likely to have a high fever and chills, feel sicker, or feel more short of breath. Exams and Tests Your health care provider will listen to the breathing sounds in your lungs with a stethoscope. Your breathing may sound abnormal or rough. Tests may include: Chest x-ray , if your provider suspects pneumonia Pulse oximetry, a painless test that helps determine the amount of oxygen in your blood by using a device placed on the end of your finger Treatment Most people DO NOT need antibiotics for acute bronchitis caused by a virus. The infection will almost always go away on its own within 1 week, though a mild cough may persist for up to 3 weeks. Doing these things may help you feel better: Drink plenty of fluids. If you have asthma or another chronic lung condition, use your inhaler . Get plenty of rest. Take aspirin or acetaminophen if you have a fever. DO NOT give aspirin to people under age 18. Breathe moist air by using a humidifier or steaming up the bathroom. Certain medicines that you can buy without a prescription can help break up or loosen mucus. Look for the word "guaifenesin" on the label. If needed, ask the pharmacist for help finding it. If your symptoms do not improve or if you are wheezing , your provider may prescribe an inhaler to open your airways. If your provider thinks you also have bacteria in your airways, they may prescribe antibiotics. This medicine will only get rid of bacteria, not viruses. Your provider may also prescribe corticosteroid medicine to reduce swelling in your lungs. If you have influenza and it is caught in the first 48 hours after getting sick, your provider might also prescribe antiviral medicine. Other tips include: DO NOT smoke. Avoid secondhand smoke and air pollution. Wash your hands (and your children's hands) often to avoid spreading viruses and other germs. Outlook (Prognosis) Except for the cough, symptoms usually go away in 7 to 10 days if you do not have a lung disorder. Coughing often lasts for 2 to 3 weeks. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you: Have a cough on most days, or have a cough that keeps returning Are coughing up blood Have a high fever or shaking chills Have a low-grade fever for 3 or more days Have thick, yellow-green mucus, especially if it has a bad smell Feel short of breath or have chest pain Have a chronic illness, like heart or lung disease Patient Instructions COPD - what to ask your doctor Using oxygen at home - what to ask your doctor Images Lungs Bronchitis Causes of acute bronchitis Lung anatomy Causes of chronic bronchitis COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder) Pulse oximeter References Bearman GM, Wenzel RP.

During pregnancy, your body will go through a lot of changes as your baby grows and your hormones change. Along with the other common symptoms during pregnancy , you will often notice new aches and pains. Headaches Headaches are common during pregnancy. Before you take medicine, ask your health care provider if it is safe to take. Other than medicine, relaxation techniques may help. Headaches can be a sign of preeclampsia (high blood pressure during pregnancy). If your headaches get worse, and they do not go away easily when you rest and take acetaminophen (Tylenol), especially toward the end of your pregnancy, tell your provider. Pain in Your Lower Abdomen (Belly) or Groin Most often, this happens between 18 and 24 weeks. When you feel stretching or pain, move slowly or change positions. This is called round ligament pain and may be helped by wearing a maternity girdle. Mild aches and pains lasting for short periods of time are normal. But see your provider right away if you have constant, severe abdominal pain, possible contractions, or you have pain and are bleeding or have fever. These are symptoms that can indicate more severe problems, such as: Placental abruption (the placenta separates from the uterus) Preterm labor Gallbladder disease Appendicitis Numbness and Tingling As your uterus grows, it may press on the nerves in your legs. This may cause some numbness and tingling (feeling of pins and needles) in your legs and toes. This is normal and will go away after you give birth (it may take a few weeks to months). You may also have numbness or tingling in your fingers and hands. You may notice it more often when you wake up in the morning. This also goes away after you give birth, though not always right away. If it is uncomfortable, you can wear a wrist brace at night. Ask your provider where to get one. Have your provider check any persistent numbness, tingling, or weakness in any extremity to ensure there is not a more serious problem. Backache Pregnancy strains your back and posture. To avoid or reduce backaches, you can: Stay physically fit, walk, and stretch regularly. Wear low-heeled shoes. Sleep on your side with a pillow between your legs. Sit in a chair with good back support. Avoid standing for too long. Bend your knees when picking things up. Do not bend at the waist. Avoid lifting heavy objects. Avoid gaining too much weight. Use heat or cold on the sore part of your back. Have someone massage or rub the sore part of your back. If you go to a professional massage therapist, let them know you are pregnant. Do back exercises that your provider suggests to relieve back stress and maintain a healthy posture. Wear a maternity girdle. Leg Aches and Pains The extra weight you carry when you are pregnant can make your legs and back hurt. Your body will also make a hormone that loosens ligaments throughout your body to prepare you for childbirth. However, these looser ligaments are more easily injured, most often in your back, so be careful when you lift and exercise. Leg cramps are common in the last months of pregnancy. Sometimes stretching your legs before bed will reduce the cramps. Your provider can show you how to safely stretch. Watch for pain and swelling in one leg, but not the other. This can be a sign of a blood clot. Let your provider know if this happens. References Cline MK, Young N. Antepartum care. In: Kellerman RD, Rakel DP, Heidelbaugh JJ, Lee EM, eds.

You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. What to Expect at the Emergency Room Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible. The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs , including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Tests that may be done include: Bronchoscopy -- camera down the throat to look for burns in the airways and lungs Chest x-ray Electrocardiogram (ECG) Endoscopy -- camera down the throat to look for burns in the esophagus and the stomach Treatment may include: Fluids through the vein (by IV) Medicine to treat symptoms Tube through the mouth into the stomach to wash out the stomach ( gastric lavage ) Washing of the skin (irrigation), perhaps every few hours for several days Surgery to remove burned skin Breathing support, including tube through the mouth into the lungs and connected to a breathing machine (ventilator) Outlook (Prognosis) How well someone does depends on how severe their poisoning is and how quickly treatment is received. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery. Damage can continue to occur for several weeks after swallowing soldering flux. Swallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue necrosis, resulting in infection, shock, and death, even several months after the substance was first swallowed. Scars may form in these tissues, leading to long-term difficulties with breathing, swallowing, and digestion. Alternative Names Fluxes; Flux poisoning References Aronson JK. Organic solvents.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a fast-growing cancer of a type of white blood cells called lymphocytes. ALL occurs when the bone marrow produces a large number of immature lymphoblasts, a cancerous form of lymphocytes. Bone marrow is the soft, spongy tissue found inside most bones in children and in the front chest bone (sternum) and the pelvis bones in adults that helps form all blood cells. The abnormal lymphoblasts grow quickly and replace normal cells in the bone marrow. ALL prevents healthy blood cells from being made. Life-threatening symptoms can occur as normal blood counts drop. Causes Most of the time, no clear cause can be found for ALL. The following factors may play a role in the development of all types of leukemia: Certain chromosome problems Exposure to radiation Past treatment with chemotherapy drugs Receiving a bone marrow transplant Toxins , such as benzene The following factors are known to increase the risk for ALL: Down syndrome or other genetic disorders A brother or sister with leukemia This type of leukemia usually affects children ages 3 to 7. ALL is the most common childhood cancer, but it can also occur in adults. Symptoms ALL makes a person more likely to bleed and develop infections. Symptoms include: Bone and joint pain Easy bruising and bleeding (such as bleeding gums, skin bleeding, nosebleeds, abnormal periods) Feeling weak or tired Fever Loss of appetite and weight loss Paleness Pain or feeling of fullness below the ribs from an enlarged liver or spleen Pinpoint red spots on the skin (petechiae) Swollen lymph nodes in the neck, under arms, and groin Night sweats These symptoms can occur with other conditions. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of specific symptoms. Exams and Tests Your provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. Blood tests may include: Complete blood count (CBC), including white blood cell (WBC) count Platelet count Bone marrow biopsy Lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) to check for leukemia cells in the spinal fluid Tests are also done to look for changes in the DNA inside the abnormal white cells. Certain DNA changes may determine how well a person does (prognosis), and what kind of treatment is recommended. Treatment The first goal of treatment is to get blood counts back to normal. If this occurs and the bone marrow looks healthy under the microscope, the cancer is said to be in remission. Chemotherapy is the first treatment tried with the goal of achieving a remission. The person may need to stay in the hospital for chemotherapy. Or it can be given at a clinic and the person goes home afterward. Chemotherapy is given into the veins (by IV) and sometimes into the fluid around the brain (the spinal fluid). Oral chemotherapy may be given after a remission to maintain it. After a remission is achieved, more treatment is given to achieve a cure. This treatment can include more IV chemotherapy or radiation to the brain . Stem cell or bone marrow transplant from another person may also be done. Further treatment depends on: Age and health of the person Genetic changes in the leukemia cells How many courses of chemotherapy it took to achieve remission If abnormal cell DNA is detected in the bone marrow after remission Availability of donors for stem cell or bone marrow transplant You and your provider may need to manage other concerns during your leukemia treatment, including: Having chemotherapy at home Managing your pets during chemotherapy Bleeding problems Dry mouth Eating enough calories Safe eating during cancer treatment Support Groups You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group . Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. Outlook (Prognosis) Those who respond to treatment right away tend to do better. Most children with ALL can be cured. Children often have a better outcome than adults. Possible Complications Both leukemia itself and the treatment can lead to many problems such as bleeding, weight loss, and infections. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you or your child develops symptoms of ALL. Prevention The risk for developing ALL may be reduced by avoiding contact with certain toxins, radiation, and chemicals.

Antibody titer blood test: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia Skip navigation An official website of the United States government Here’s how you know Here’s how you know Official websites use .gov A .gov website belongs to an official government

Antibody titer is a laboratory test that measures the level of antibodies in a blood sample. How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed . How to Prepare for the Test No special preparation is necessary for this test. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed The antibody level (titer) in the blood tells your health care provider whether or not you have been exposed to an antigen , or something that the body thinks is foreign. The body uses antibodies to attack and remove foreign substances. In some situations, your provider may check your antibody titer to see if you had an infection in the past (for example, chickenpox or measles) or to decide which vaccines you need. The antibody titer is also used to determine: The strength of an immune response to the body's own tissue in diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) and other autoimmune disorders If you need a booster vaccine Whether a vaccine you had before helped your immune system protect you against the specific disease If you have had a recent or past infection, such as mononucleosis or viral hepatitis Normal Results Normal values depend on the antibody being tested. If the test is being done to look for antibodies against your own body tissues, the normal value would be zero or negative. In some cases, a normal level is below a specific number. If the test is being done to see if a vaccine fully protects you against a disease, the normal result depends on the specific value for that immunization. Negative antibody tests can help rule out certain infections. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean Abnormal results depend on which antibodies are being measured. Abnormal results may be due to: Autoimmune disease Failure of a vaccine to fully protect you against a certain disease Immune deficiency Viral infections Risks There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Multiple punctures to locate veins Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names Titer - antibodies; Serum antibodies Images Antibody titer References Kroger AT, Pickering LK, Mawle A, Hinman AR, Orenstein WA.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a laboratory test to measure the amount of AAT in your blood. The test is also done to check for abnormal forms of AAT. How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed. How to Prepare for the Test There is no special preparation. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed This test is helpful in identifying a rare form of emphysema in adults and a rare form of liver disease (cirrhosis) in children and adults caused by an AAT deficiency . AAT deficiency is passed down through families. The condition causes the liver to make too little of AAT, a protein that protects the lungs and liver from damage. Everyone has two copies of the gene that makes AAT. People with two abnormal copies of the gene have more severe disease and lower blood levels. Normal Results Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean A lower-than-normal level of AAT may be associated with: Damage of the large airways in the lungs ( bronchiectasis ) Scarring of the liver ( cirrhosis ) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Liver tumors Yellowing of the skin and eyes due to blocked bile flow ( obstructive jaundice ) High blood pressure in the large vein that leads to the liver (portal hypertension) Risks There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Fainting or feeling lightheaded Multiple punctures to locate veins Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk anytime the skin is broken) Alternative Names A1AT test References Chernecky CC, Berger BJ.

Absence of a woman's monthly menstrual period is called amenorrhea. Primary amenorrhea is when a girl has not yet started her monthly periods, and she: Has gone through other normal changes that occur during puberty Is older than 15 Causes Most girls begin their periods between ages 9 and 18. The average is around 12 years old. If no periods have occurred when a girl is older than 15, further testing may be needed. The need is more urgent if she has gone through other normal changes that occur during puberty. Being born with incompletely formed genital or pelvic organs can lead to a lack of menstrual periods. Some of these defects include: Blockages or narrowing of the cervix Hymen that has no opening Missing uterus or vagina Vaginal septum (a wall that divides the vagina into 2 sections) Hormones play a big role in a woman's menstrual cycle. Hormone problems can occur when: Changes occur to the parts of the brain where hormones that help manage the menstrual cycle are produced. The ovaries are not working correctly. Either of these problems may be due to: Anorexia (loss of appetite) with low body mass index (BMI) Chronic or long-term illnesses, such as cystic fibrosis or heart disease Genetic defects or disorders Infections that occurred before or after the woman's birth Other birth defects Poor nutrition Tumors In many cases, the cause of primary amenorrhea is not known. Symptoms A female with amenorrhea will have no menstrual flow. She may have other signs of puberty. Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform a physical exam to check for birth defects of the vagina or uterus. The provider will ask questions about: Your medical history Medicines and supplements you may be taking How much exercise you do Your eating habits A pregnancy test will be done. Blood tests to measure different hormone levels may include: Estradiol Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) Luteinizing hormone (LH) Prolactin 17 hydroxyprogesterone Serum progesterone Serum testosterone level Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) T3 and T4 Other tests that may be done include: Chromosome or genetic testing Head CT scan or head MRI scan to look for brain tumors Pelvic ultrasound or MRI to look for birth defects Treatment Treatment depends on the cause of the missing period. Lack of periods that is caused by birth defects may require hormone medicines, surgery, or both. If the amenorrhea is caused by a tumor in the brain: Medicines may shrink certain types of tumors. Surgery to remove the tumor may also be needed. Radiation therapy is usually only done when other treatments have not worked. If the problem is caused by a systemic disease, treatment of the disease may allow menstruation to begin. If the cause is bulimia , anorexia or too much exercise, periods will often begin when the weight returns to normal or the exercise level is decreased. If the amenorrhea cannot be corrected, hormone medicines can sometimes be used. Medicines can help the woman feel more like her friends and female family members. They can also protect the bones from becoming too thin ( osteoporosis ). Outlook (Prognosis) The outlook depends on the cause of the amenorrhea and whether it can be corrected with treatment or lifestyle changes. Periods are not likely to start on their own if the amenorrhea was caused by one of the following conditions: Birth defects of the female organs Craniopharyngioma (a tumor near the pituitary gland at the base of the brain) Cystic fibrosis Genetic disorders You may have emotional distress because you feel different from friends or family. Or, you may worry that you might not be able to have children. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if your daughter is older than 15 and has not yet begun menstruating, or if she is 14 or older and shows no other signs of puberty.

Asbestosis is a lung disease that occurs from breathing in asbestos fibers. Causes Breathing in asbestos fibers can cause scar tissue (fibrosis) to form inside the lung. Scarred lung tissue does not expand and contract normally. How severe the disease is depends on: How long the person was exposed to asbestos The amount that was breathed in The type of fibers breathed in Often, the symptoms aren't noticed for 20 years or more after the asbestos exposure. Asbestos fibers were commonly used in construction before 1975. Asbestos exposure occurs in asbestos mining and milling, construction, fireproofing, and other industries. Household members of asbestos workers can also be exposed from asbestos particles brought home on the worker's clothing. Other asbestos-related diseases include: Pleural plaques Malignant mesothelioma (cancer of the pleura, the lining of the lung), which can develop 20 to 40 years after exposure Pleural effusion , which is a collection of fluid that develops around the lung a few years after asbestos exposure and is benign Lung cancer These conditions can coexist with asbestosis. Workers today are less likely to get asbestos-related diseases because of government regulations. Cigarette smoking increases the risk of developing asbestos-related diseases. Symptoms Symptoms may include any of the following: Chest pain Cough Shortness of breath with activity (slowly gets worse over time) Tightness in the chest Possible other symptoms include: Clubbing of fingers Nail abnormalities Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms. When listening to the chest with a stethoscope, the provider may hear crackling sounds called rales. These tests may help diagnose the disease: Chest x-ray CT scan of the lungs Lung function tests Pleural plaques in the chest x-ray or CT scan can help diagnose asbestosis and differentiate from other forms of pulmonary fibrosis. Treatment There is no cure. Stopping exposure to asbestos is essential. To ease symptoms, drainage and chest percussion can help remove fluids from the lungs. Your provider may prescribe aerosol medicines to thin lung fluids. People with this condition may need to receive oxygen by mask or by a plastic piece that fits into the nostrils. Certain people may need a lung transplant. Support Groups You can ease the stress of this illness by joining a lung support group . Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. More information and support for people with asbestosis and their families can be found at: American Lung Association -- www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/asbestosis The Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization -- www.asbestosdiseaseawareness.org/ United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration -- www.osha.gov/asbestos Outlook (Prognosis) Outcome depends on the amount of asbestos you were exposed to and how long you were exposed. People who develop malignant mesothelioma tend to have a poor outcome. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you suspect that you have been exposed to asbestos and you have breathing problems. Having asbestosis makes it easier for you to develop lung infections. Talk to your provider about getting the flu, pneumonia, and other vaccines. If you've been diagnosed with asbestosis, call your provider right away if you develop a cough, shortness of breath, fever, or other signs of a lung infection, especially if you think you have the flu. Since your lungs are already damaged, it's very important to have the infection treated right away. This will prevent breathing problems from becoming severe, as well as further damage to your lungs. Prevention In people who have been exposed to asbestos for more than 10 years, screening with a chest x-ray every 3 to 5 years may detect asbestos-related diseases early. Stopping cigarette smoking can greatly reduce the risk of asbestos-related lung cancer.

An abscess is a collection of pus in any part of the body. In most cases, the area around an abscess is swollen and inflamed. Causes Abscesses occur when an area of tissue becomes infected and the body's immune system tries to fight and contain it. White blood cells (WBCs) move through the walls of the blood vessels into the area of the infection and collect in the damaged tissue. During this process, pus forms. Pus is the buildup of fluid, living and dead white blood cells, dead tissue, and bacteria or other foreign substances. Abscesses can form in almost any part of the body. The skin, under the skin, and the teeth are the most common sites. Abscesses may be caused by bacteria, parasites, and foreign substances. Abscesses in the skin are easy to see. They are red, raised, and painful. Abscesses in other areas of the body may not be seen, but they may cause organ damage. Some types and locations of abscesses include: Abdominal abscess Amebic liver abscess Anorectal abscess Bartholin gland abscess Brain abscess Epidural abscess Peritonsillar abscess Pyogenic liver abscess Spinal cord abscess Subcutaneous (skin) abscess Tooth abscess Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform a physical exam, focusing on the symptoms of the abscess. Tests to locate the abscess include: Ultrasound CT scan MRI scan X-ray (mainly for tooth abscess) Often, a sample of fluid will be taken from the abscess and tested to see what type of germ is causing the problem. Treatment Treatment varies, but often surgery is needed to drain the abscess. Antibiotics can also be used. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you think that you have any type of abscess. Contact your dentist if you think that you have a tooth abscess. Prevention Preventing abscesses depends on where they develop. For example, good hygiene can help prevent skin abscesses. Dental hygiene and routine care will prevent tooth abscesses.

Your hair and nails help protect your body. They also keep the temperature of your body steady. As you age, your hair and nails begin to change. HAIR CHANGES AND THEIR EFFECTS Hair color change . This is one of the clearest signs of aging. Hair color is due to a pigment called melanin , which hair follicles produce. Hair follicles are structures in the skin that make and grow hair. With aging, the follicles make less melanin, and this causes gray hair. Graying often begins in the 30s. Scalp hair often starts graying at the temples and extends to the top of the scalp. Hair color becomes lighter, eventually turning white. Body and facial hair also turn gray, but most often, this happens later than scalp hair. Hair in the armpit, chest, and pubic area may gray less or not at all. Graying is largely determined by your genes. Gray hair tends to occur earlier in white people and later in Asians. Nutritional supplements, vitamins, and other products will not stop or decrease the rate of graying. Hair thickness change . Hair is made of many protein strands. A single hair has a normal life between 2 and 7 years. That hair then falls out and is replaced with a new hair. How much hair you have on your body and head is also determined by your genes. Nearly everyone has some hair loss with aging. The rate of hair growth also slows. Hair strands become smaller and have less pigment. So the thick, coarse hair of a young adult eventually becomes thin, fine, light-colored hair. Many hair follicles stop producing new hairs. Men may start showing signs of baldness by the time they are 30 years old. Many men are nearly bald by age 60. A type of baldness related to the normal function of the male hormone testosterone is called male-pattern baldness . Hair loss may be at the temples or at the top of the head. Women can develop a similar type of baldness as they age. This is called female-pattern baldness . Hair becomes less dense and the scalp may become visible. As you age, your body and face also lose hair. Women's remaining facial hair may get coarser, most often on the chin and around the lips. Men may grow longer and coarser eyebrow, ear, and nose hair. Contact your health care provider if you have sudden hair loss. This can be a symptom of a health problem. NAIL CHANGES AND THEIR EFFECTS Your nails also change with age. They grow more slowly and may become dull and brittle. They may also become yellowed and opaque. Nails, particularly toenails, may become hard and thick. Ingrown toenails may be more common. The tips of the fingernails may break. Lengthwise ridges may develop in the fingernails and toenails. Check with your provider if your nails develop pits, ridges, lines, changes in shape, or other changes. These can be related to iron deficiency, kidney disease, and nutritional deficiencies.

Abdominal sounds are the noises made by the intestines. Considerations Abdominal sounds (bowel sounds) are made by the movement of the intestines as they push food through. The intestines are hollow, so bowel sounds echo through the abdomen much like the sounds heard from water pipes. Most bowel sounds are normal. They simply mean that the gastrointestinal tract is working. A health care provider can check abdominal sounds by listening to the abdomen with a stethoscope ( auscultation ). Most bowel sounds are harmless. However, there are some cases in which abnormal sounds can indicate a problem. Ileus is a condition in which there is a lack of intestinal activity. Many medical conditions may lead to ileus. This problem can cause gas, fluids, and the contents of the intestines to build up and break open (rupture) the bowel wall. The provider may be unable to hear any bowel sounds when listening to the abdomen. Reduced (hypoactive) bowel sounds include a reduction in the loudness, tone, or regularity of the sounds. They are a sign that intestinal activity has slowed. Hypoactive bowel sounds are normal during sleep. They also occur normally for a short time after the use of certain medicines and after abdominal surgery. Decreased or absent bowel sounds often indicate constipation. Increased ( hyperactive ) bowel sounds can sometimes be heard even without a stethoscope. Hyperactive bowel sounds mean there is an increase in intestinal activity. This may happen with diarrhea or after eating. Abdominal sounds are always evaluated together with symptoms such as: Gas Nausea Presence or absence of bowel movements Vomiting If bowel sounds are hypoactive or hyperactive and there are other abnormal symptoms, you should continue to follow-up with your provider. For example, no bowel sounds after a period of hyperactive bowel sounds can mean there is a rupture of the intestines, or strangulation of the bowel and death ( necrosis ) of the bowel tissue. Very high-pitched bowel sounds may be a sign of early bowel obstruction. Causes Most of the sounds you hear in your stomach and intestines are due to normal digestion. They are not a cause for concern. Many conditions can cause hyperactive or hypoactive bowel sounds. Most are harmless and do not need to be treated. The following is a list of more serious conditions that can cause abnormal bowel sounds. Hyperactive, hypoactive, or missing bowel sounds may be caused by: Blocked blood vessels prevent the intestines from getting proper blood flow. For example, blood clots can cause mesenteric artery occlusion . Mechanical bowel obstruction is caused by hernia , tumor , adhesions , or similar conditions that can block the intestines. Paralytic ileus is a problem with the nerves to the intestines. Other causes of hypoactive bowel sounds include: Drugs that slow down movement in the intestines such as opioids (including codeine), anticholinergics, and phenothiazines General anesthesia Radiation to the abdomen Spinal anesthesia Surgery in the abdomen Other causes of hyperactive bowel sounds include: Crohn disease Diarrhea Food allergy GI bleeding Infectious enteritis Ulcerative colitis When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have any symptoms such as: Bleeding from your rectum Nausea Diarrhea or constipation that continues Vomiting What to Expect at Your Office Visit The provider will examine you and ask you questions about your medical history and symptoms. You may be asked: What other symptoms do you have? Do you have abdominal pain ? Do you have diarrhea or constipation? Do you have abdominal distention ? Do you have excessive or absent gas (flatus) ? Have you noticed any bleeding from the rectum or black stools? You may need the following tests: Abdominal CT scan Abdominal x-ray Blood tests Endoscopy If there are signs of an emergency, you will be sent to the hospital. A tube may be placed through your nose or mouth into the stomach or intestines. This empties your intestines. In most cases, you will not be allowed to eat or drink anything so your intestines can rest. You will be given fluids through a vein (intravenously). You may be given medicine to reduce symptoms and to treat the cause of the problem. The type of medicine will depend on the cause of the problem. Some people may need surgery right away.

Aftershave is a lotion, gel, or liquid applied to the face after shaving. Many men use it. This article discusses the harmful effects from swallowing aftershave products. This article is for information only. Do NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. Poisonous Ingredient The harmful ingredients in aftershave are: Ethyl alcohol Isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) Aftershave may contain other harmful substances. Where Found Aftershaves are sold under various brand names. Symptoms Symptoms of aftershave poisoning may include: Abdominal pain Change in alertness level (may become unconscious) Coma (decreased level of consciousness and lack of responsiveness) Eye irritation (burning, redness, tears) Headache Low body temperature Low blood pressure Low blood sugar Nausea and vomiting (may contain blood) Rapid heart rate Slowed breathing Slurred speech Stupor Throat pain Unable to walk normally Urination difficulties (too much or too little urine output) Isopropanol may cause these other symptoms: Dizziness Unresponsive reflexes Uncoordinated movement Children are especially prone to developing low blood sugar, which may cause these symptoms: Confusion Irritability Nausea Sleepiness Weakness Home Care Seek medical help right away. DO NOT make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to. If the person can swallow normally, give them water or milk, unless a provider tells you not to. DO NOT give water or milk if they have symptoms that make it hard to swallow. These include: Vomiting Seizures A decreased level of alertness Before Calling Emergency Have this information ready: Person's age, weight, and condition Name of the product (ingredients, if known) Time it was swallowed Amount swallowed Poison Control Your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. What to Expect at the Emergency Room Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible. The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated. The person may receive: Blood and urine tests Breathing support, including tube through the mouth into the lungs and breathing machine (ventilator) Chest x-ray ECG (electrocardiogram or heart tracing) Dialysis (kidney machine) Endoscopy (camera placed down the throat to see burns in the esophagus and the stomach, if vomiting blood) Fluids through a vein (by IV) Laxative Medicine to treat the effects of the poison Outlook (Prognosis) Aftershave poisoning is more common in small children than in older children or adults. Alcoholics may drink aftershave when other alcohol runs out. The outcome depends on how much the person swallows. The range of illness may vary from a condition similar to being drunk to coma, seizures, and severe lung problems. A product with more isopropyl alcohol could cause a more serious illness. Complications, such as pneumonia, muscle damage from lying on a hard surface for a prolonged period of time, or brain damage from lack of oxygen, may cause permanent disability. Aftershave poisoning is not deadly in most cases. References Nelson ME. Toxic alcohols. In: Walls RM, ed. Rosen's Emergency Medicine: Concepts and Clinical Practice . 10th ed.

Ataxia-telangiectasia is a rare childhood disease. It affects the brain and other parts of the body. Ataxia refers to uncoordinated movements, such as walking. Telangiectasias are enlarged blood vessels (capillaries) just below the surface of the skin. Telangiectasias appear as tiny, red, spider-like blood vessels. Causes Ataxia-telangiectasia is inherited. This means it is passed down through families. It is an autosomal recessive trait. Both parents must provide a copy of a nonworking gene for the child to have symptoms of the disorder. The disease results from a variant in the ATM gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control the rate at which cells grow and divide. Defects in this gene can lead to abnormal cell death in many sites of the body, including the part of the brain that helps coordinate movement. Boys and girls are equally affected. Symptoms Symptoms include: Decreased coordination of movements (ataxia) in late childhood that can include ataxic gait (cerebellar ataxia ), jerky gait, unsteadiness Decreasing mental development, slows or stops after age 10 to 12 Delayed walking Discoloration of skin areas exposed to sunlight Discoloration of skin (coffee-with-milk-colored spots) Enlarged blood vessels in skin of nose, ears, and inside of the elbow and knee Enlarged blood vessels in the whites of the eyes Jerky or abnormal eye movements ( nystagmus ) late in the disease Premature graying of the hair Seizures Sensitivity to radiation, including x-rays Severe respiratory infections that keep coming back (recurring) Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. The exam may show signs of the following: Tonsils, lymph nodes, and spleen below normal size Decreased to absent deep tendon reflexes Delayed or absent physical and sexual development Growth failure Mask-like face Multiple skin coloring and texture changes Possible tests include: Alpha fetoprotein B and T cell screen Carcinoembryonic antigen Genetic testing to look for changes in the ATM gene Glucose tolerance test Serum immunoglobulin levels (IgE, IgA) X-ray or CT scan to look at the size of the thymus gland Treatment There is no specific treatment for ataxia-telangiectasia. Treatment is directed at specific symptoms. Support Groups More information and support for people with ataxia-telangiectasia condition and their families can be found at: Ataxia Telangiectasia Children's Project: www.atcp.org National Ataxia Foundation (NAF): www.ataxia.org Outlook (Prognosis) Early death is common, but life expectancy varies. Because people with this condition are very sensitive to radiation, they should never be given radiation therapy, and no unnecessary x-rays should be done. Possible Complications Complications may include: Cancer, such as lymphoma Diabetes Kyphosis Progressive movement disorder that leads to wheelchair use Scoliosis Severe, recurrent lung infections When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if your child develops symptoms of this disorder. Prevention Couples with a family history of this condition who are considering pregnancy may consider genetic counseling. Parents of a child with this disorder may have a slight increased risk for cancer. They should have genetic counseling and increased cancer screenings.

Angioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. These blood vessels are called the coronary arteries. A coronary artery stent is a small, metal mesh tube that expands inside a coronary artery. When You're in the Hospital You had angioplasty when you were in the hospital. You may have also had a stent placed. Both of these were done to open narrowed or blocked coronary arteries, the blood vessels that supply blood to your heart. You may have had a heart attack or angina (chest pain) before the procedure. Watch this video about: Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) What to Expect at Home You may have pain in your groin area, arm, or wrist. This is from the catheter (flexible tube) that was inserted to do the procedure. You may also have some bruising around and below the incision. The chest pain and shortness of breath you likely had before the procedure should be much better now. Self-care In general, people who have angioplasty can walk around within 6 hours after the procedure. You may be able to be up and walking earlier if the procedure was performed through the wrist. Complete recovery takes a week or less. Keep the area where the catheter was inserted dry for 24 to 48 hours. If the provider put the catheter in through your groin: Walking short distances on a flat surface is OK. Limit going up and down stairs to around 2 times a day for the first 2 to 3 days. Don't do yard work, drive, squat, carry heavy objects, or play sports for at least 2 days, or until your health care provider tells you it is safe. If the provider put the catheter in your arm or wrist: Don't lift anything heavier than 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) (a little more than a gallon of milk) with the arm that had the catheter. Don't do any heavy pushing, pulling or twisting with that arm. For a catheter in your groin, arm, or wrist: Avoid sexual activity for 2 to 5 days. Ask your provider when it will be OK to start again. Don't take a bath or swim for the first week. You may take showers, but make sure the area where the catheter was inserted does not get wet for the first 24 to 48 hours. You should be able to return to work in 2 to 3 days if you do not do heavy work. You will need to care for your incision. Your provider will tell you how often to change your dressing. If your incision bleeds or swells up, lie down and put pressure on it for 30 minutes. Angioplasty does not cure the cause of the blockage in your arteries. Your arteries may become narrow again. Eat a heart-healthy diet, exercise, stop smoking (if you smoke), and reduce stress to help lower your chances of having a blocked artery again. Your provider may give you medicine to help lower your cholesterol. Most people take aspirin together with another antiplatelet medicine such as clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Efient), or ticagrelor (Brilinta) after this procedure. These medicines are blood thinners. They keep your blood from forming clots in your arteries and stent. A blood clot can lead to a heart attack. Take the medicines exactly as your provider tells you. Do not stop taking them without talking with your provider first. You should know how to take care of your angina if it returns. Make sure you have a follow-up appointment scheduled with your heart care provider (cardiologist). Your provider may refer you to a cardiac rehabilitation program. This will help you learn how to slowly increase your exercise . You will also learn how to take care of your angina and care for yourself after a heart attack . When to Call the Doctor Contact your provider if: There is bleeding at the catheter insertion site that does not stop when you apply pressure. There is swelling at the catheter site. Your leg or arm below where the catheter was inserted changes color, becomes cool to touch, or is numb. The small incision for your catheter becomes red or painful, or yellow or green discharge is draining from it. You have chest pain or shortness of breath that does not go away with rest. Your pulse feels irregular -- very slow (fewer than 60 beats), or very fast (over 100 to 120 beats) a minute. You have dizziness, fainting, or you are very tired. You are coughing up blood or yellow or green mucus. You have problems taking any of your heart medicines. You have chills or a fever over 101°F (38.3°C).

An arm MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan uses strong magnets to create pictures of the upper and lower arm. This may include the elbow, wrist, hands, fingers, and the surrounding muscles and other tissues. It does not use radiation (x-rays). Single MRI images are called slices. The images can be stored on a computer or printed on film. One exam produces many images. How the Test is Performed You will wear a hospital gown or clothes without metal zippers or snaps (such as sweatpants and a t-shirt). Make sure you take off your watch, jewelry, and wallet. MRI can pull on any metallic objects. Some types of metal can cause blurry images. You will lie on a narrow table that slides into a large tunnel-like scanner. Some exams use a special dye (contrast). Most of the time, you will get the dye through a vein in your arm or hand before the test. The dye helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly. During the MRI, the person who operates the machine will watch you from another room. The test most often lasts 30 to 60 minutes, but may take longer. How to Prepare for the Test You may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the scan. Tell your health care provider if you are afraid of closed spaces (have claustrophobia). You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious. Your provider may suggest an "open" MRI, in which the machine is not as close to the body. Before the test, tell your provider if you have: Brain aneurysm clips Certain types of artificial heart valves Heart defibrillator or pacemaker Inner ear (cochlear) implants Kidney disease or dialysis (you may not be able to receive contrast) Recently placed artificial joints or surgery with metal plates and screws Certain types of vascular stents Worked with sheet metal in the past (you may need tests to check for metal pieces in your eyes) Because the MRI contains strong magnets, metal objects are not allowed into the room with the MRI scanner: Pens, pocketknives, and eyeglasses may fly across the room. Items such as jewelry, watches, credit cards, and hearing aids can be damaged. Pins, hairpins, metal zippers, and similar metallic items can distort the images. Removable dental work should be taken out just before the scan. How the Test will Feel An MRI exam causes no pain. You will need to lie still. Too much movement can blur MRI images and cause errors. The table may be hard or cold, but you can ask for a blanket or pillow. The machine makes loud thumping and humming noises when turned on. You can wear ear plugs to help block out the noise. An intercom in the room allows you to speak to someone at any time. Some MRIs have televisions and special headphones to help the time pass. There is no recovery time, unless you were given a medicine to relax. After an MRI scan, you can return to your normal diet, activity, and medicines. Why the Test is Performed This test provides clear pictures of parts of the arm that are hard to see clearly on CT scans. Your provider may order this test if you have: A mass that can be felt on a physical exam An abnormal finding on an x-ray or bone scan Arm pain and a history of cancer Arm or wrist pain that does not get better with treatment Bone infection (osteomyelitis) Bone pain and fever Broken bone Decreased motion or "locking up" of the wrist or elbow joint Redness or swelling of the wrist or elbow joints Injuries to the cartilage and ligaments Deformity to allow your physician assess the condition better Normal Results A normal result means your arm looks OK. What Abnormal Results Mean Abnormal results may be due to: Degenerative changes due to age Abscess Bursitis of the elbow or wrist Broken bone or fracture Ganglion cyst in the wrist Infection in the bone Ligament, tendon, or cartilage injury in the wrist or elbow Muscle damage Osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis) Tumor or cancer in the bone, muscle, or soft tissue Talk to your provider if you have questions and concerns. Risks MRI uses no radiation. There have been no reported side effects from the magnetic fields and radio waves. It is also safe to have MRI performed during pregnancy. No side effects or complications have been proven. The most common type of contrast (dye) used is gadolinium. It is very safe. Allergic reactions to the substance are rare. However, gadolinium can be harmful to people with kidney problems that need dialysis. If you have kidney problems, please tell your provider before the test. The strong magnetic fields created during an MRI can cause heart pacemakers and other implants to not work as well. It can also cause a piece of metal inside your body to move or shift. For safety reasons, please do not bring anything that contains metal into the scanner room. Considerations Tests that may be done instead of an MRI of the arm include: CT scan of the arm Arm x-ray A CT scan may be preferred in an emergency. The test is faster than MRI and often available in the emergency room. Alternative Names MRI - arm; Wrist MRI; MRI - wrist; Elbow MRI; MRI - elbow References Anderson MW, Fox MG. MRI of the arm.

Apraxia is a disorder of the brain and nervous system in which a person is unable to perform tasks or movements when asked, even though: The request or command is understood They are willing to perform the task The muscles needed to perform the task work properly The task may have already been learned Causes Apraxia is caused by damage to the brain. When apraxia develops in a person who was previously able to perform the tasks or abilities, it is called acquired apraxia. The most common causes of acquired apraxia are: Brain tumor Condition that causes gradual worsening of the brain and nervous system (neurodegenerative illness) Dementia Stroke Traumatic brain injury Hydrocephalus Apraxia may also be seen at birth. Symptoms appear as the child grows and develops. The cause is unknown. Apraxia of speech is often present along with another speech disorder called aphasia. Depending on the cause of apraxia, a number of other brain or nervous system problems may be present. Symptoms A person with apraxia is unable to put together the correct order of muscle movements. At times, a completely different word or action is used than the one the person intended to speak or make. The person is often aware of the mistake. Symptoms of apraxia of speech include: Distorted, repeated, or left out speech sounds or words. The person has difficulty putting words together in the correct order. Struggling to pronounce the right word. More difficulty using longer words, either all the time, or sometimes. Ability to use short, everyday phrases or sayings (such as "How are you?") without a problem. Better writing ability than speaking ability. Other forms of apraxia include: Buccofacial or orofacial apraxia. Inability to carry out movements of the face on demand, such as licking the lips, sticking out the tongue, or whistling. Ideational apraxia. Inability to carry out learned, complex tasks in the proper order, such as putting on socks before putting on shoes. Ideomotor apraxia. Inability to voluntarily perform a learned task when given the necessary objects. For instance, if given a screwdriver, the person may try to write with it as if it were a pen. Limb-kinetic apraxia. Difficulty making precise movements with an arm or leg. It becomes impossible to button a shirt or tie a shoe. In gait apraxia, it becomes impossible for a person to take even a small step. Gait apraxia is commonly seen in normal pressure hydrocephalus. Exams and Tests The following tests may be done if the cause of the disorder is not known: CT or MRI scans of the brain may help show a tumor, stroke, or other brain injury. An electroencephalogram (EEG) may be used to rule out epilepsy as a cause of the apraxia. A spinal tap may be done to check for inflammation or an infection that affects the brain. Standardized language and intellectual tests should be done if apraxia of speech is suspected. Testing for other learning disabilities may also be needed. Treatment People with apraxia can benefit from treatment by a health care team. The team should also include family members. Occupational and speech therapists play an important role in helping both people with apraxia and their caregivers learn ways to deal with the disorder. During treatment, therapists will focus on: Repeating sounds over and over to teach mouth movements Slowing down the person's speech Teaching different techniques to help with communication Recognition and treatment of depression is important for people with apraxia. To help with communication, family and friends should: Avoid giving complex directions. Use simple phrases to avoid misunderstandings. Speak in a normal tone of voice. Speech apraxia is not a hearing problem. Do not assume that the person understands. Provide communication aids, if possible, depending on the person and condition. Other tips for daily living include: Maintain a relaxed, calm environment. Take time to show someone with apraxia how to do a task, and allow enough time for them to do so. Do not ask them to repeat the task if they are clearly struggling with it because it will increase their frustration. Suggest other ways to do the same things. For example, buy shoes with a hook and loop closure instead of laces. If depression or frustration is severe, mental health counseling may help. Outlook (Prognosis) Many people with apraxia are no longer able to be independent and may have trouble performing everyday tasks. Ask the health care provider which activities may or may not be safe. Avoid activities that may cause injury and take the proper safety measures. Possible Complications Having apraxia may lead to: Learning problems Low self-esteem Social problems When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact the provider if someone has difficulty performing everyday tasks or has other symptoms of apraxia after a stroke or brain injury. Prevention Reducing your risk of stroke and brain injury may help prevent conditions that lead to apraxia.

A ligament is a band of tissue that connects a bone to another bone. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is located inside your knee joint and connects the bones of your upper and lower leg. An ACL injury occurs when the ligament is stretched or torn. A partial ACL tear occurs when only part of the ligament is torn. A complete ACL tear occurs when the entire ligament is torn into two pieces or detaches from the bone. More About Your Injury The ACL is one of several ligaments that keep your knee stable. It helps keep your leg bones in place and allows your knee to move back and forth. An ACL injury can occur if you: Get hit very hard on the side of your knee, such as during a football tackle Twist your knee Quickly stop moving and change direction while running, landing from a jump, or turning Land awkwardly after jumping Skiers and people who play basketball, football, or soccer are more likely to have this type of injury. Women are more likely to tear their ACL than men when they participate in sports. What to Expect It is common to hear a "popping" sound when an ACL injury occurs. You also may have: Knee swelling that occurs within a few hours of injury Knee pain , especially when you try to put weight on the injured leg\ Knee instability when you start putting weight on it If you have a mild injury, you may notice that your knee feels unstable or seems to "give way" when using it. ACL injuries often occur along with other knee injuries, such as to the cartilage called the meniscus. These injuries also may need to be treated, sometimes with surgery. After examining your knee, your health care provider may order these imaging tests: X-rays to check for damage to the bones in your knee. An MRI of the knee . An MRI machine takes special pictures of the tissues inside your knee. The pictures will show whether these tissues have been stretched or torn. If you have an ACL injury, you may need: Crutches to walk until the swelling and pain get better A brace to support and stabilize your knee Physical therapy to help improve joint motion and leg strength Surgery to reconstruct the ACL and other structures that also may have been injured Some people can live and function normally with a torn ACL. However, most people feel like their knee is unstable and may "give out" with more rigorous activities. Most people will have the ACL reconstructed in order to return to their previous activities. Unrepaired ACL tears can lead to further knee damage, especially to the meniscus. Self-care at Home Follow R.I.C.E. to help reduce pain and swelling: Rest your leg. Avoid putting weight on it. Ice your knee for 20 minutes at a time 3 to 4 times a day. Do not apply ice directly to your skin. Wrap the ice in a clean cloth first. Compress the area by wrapping it with an elastic bandage or compression wrap. Elevate your leg by raising it above the level of your heart. You can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) to reduce pain and swelling. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) helps with pain, but not with swelling. You can buy these pain medicines at the store. Talk with your provider before using pain medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past. Do not take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or by your provider. Activity After your injury, you should not play sports or do other strenuous activities until you and your provider decide what treatment is best for you. If you have surgery to reconstruct your ACL: Follow instructions on self-care at home. You will need physical therapy to regain the full use of your knee. Your recovery after surgery can take about 6 months. But you should be able to do the same activities you did before. If you do not have surgery: You will need to work with a physical therapist to lessen swelling and pain and regain enough range of motion and strength in your leg to resume activity. This may take a few months. Depending on your injury, you may not be able to do certain types of activities that could re-injure your knee. When to Call the Doctor Contact your provider if you have any of the following: Increase in swelling or pain Self-care does not seem to help You lose feeling in your foot Your foot or leg feels cold or changes color Your knee suddenly locks and you can't straighten it If you have surgery, contact your surgeon if you have: A fever of 100°F (38°C) or higher Drainage from the incisions Bleeding that won't stop Alternative Names Cruciate ligament injury - aftercare; ACL injury - aftercare; Knee injury - anterior cruciate References Lamplot JD, Bogunovic L, Wright RW.

Alcoholic liver disease is damage to the liver and its function due to alcohol abuse . Causes Alcoholic liver disease most often occurs after years of heavy drinking. Over time, scarring and cirrhosis can occur. Cirrhosis is the final phase of alcoholic liver disease. Alcoholic liver disease does not occur in all heavy drinkers. The chances of getting liver disease go up the longer you have been drinking and more alcohol you consume. You do not have to get drunk for the disease to happen. The disease is most common in people between 40 and 50 years of age. Men are more likely to have this problem. However, women may develop the disease after less exposure to alcohol than men. Some people may have an inherited risk for the disease. Symptoms There may be no symptoms, or symptoms may come on slowly. This depends on how well the liver is working. Symptoms tend to be worse after a period of heavy drinking. Early symptoms include: Loss of energy Poor appetite and weight loss Nausea Belly pain Small, red spider-like blood vessels on the skin As liver function worsens, symptoms may include: Fluid buildup of the legs (edema) and in the abdomen ( ascites ) Yellow color in the skin, mucous membranes, or eyes ( jaundice ) Redness on the palms of the hands In men, impotence, shrinking of the testicles, and breast swelling Easy bruising and abnormal bleeding Confusion or problems thinking Pale or clay-colored stools Bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract Exams and Tests Your health care provider will do a physical exam to look for: An enlarged liver or spleen Excess breast tissue in men Swollen abdomen, as a result of too much fluid Reddened palms Red spider-like blood vessels on the skin Small testicles Widened veins in the wall of the abdomen Yellow eyes or skin (jaundice) Tests you may have include: Complete blood count (CBC) Liver function tests Coagulation studies Liver biopsy Tests to rule out other diseases include: Abdominal CT scan Blood tests for other causes of liver disease Ultrasound of the abdomen Ultrasound elastography Treatment LIFESTYLE CHANGES Some things you can do to help take care of your liver disease are: Stop drinking alcohol. Eat a healthy diet that is low in salt. Get vaccinated for diseases such as influenza, hepatitis A and hepatitis B, and pneumococcal pneumonia. Talk to your provider about all medicines you take, including herbs and supplements and over-the-counter medicines. MEDICINES FROM YOUR DOCTOR "Water pills" (diuretics) to get rid of fluid buildup Vitamin K or blood products to prevent excess bleeding Medicines for mental confusion Antibiotics for infections OTHER TREATMENTS Endoscopic treatments for enlarged veins in the esophagus (esophageal varices) Removal of fluid from the abdomen (paracentesis) Placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) to repair blood flow in the liver When cirrhosis progresses to end-stage liver disease, a liver transplant may be needed. Liver transplantation for alcoholic liver disease is only considered in people who have completely avoided alcohol for 6 months. Support Groups More information and support for people with alcoholic liver disease and their families can be found by joining support groups for alcoholism or liver disease . Outlook (Prognosis) Alcoholic liver disease is treatable if it is caught before it causes severe damage. However, continued excessive drinking can shorten your lifespan. Cirrhosis further worsens the condition and can lead to serious complications. In case of severe damage, the liver cannot heal or return to normal function. Possible Complications Complications may include: Bleeding disorders (coagulopathy) Buildup of fluid in the abdomen (ascites) and infection of the fluid (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis - SBP) Enlarged veins in the esophagus, stomach, or intestines that bleed easily (esophageal varices) Increased pressure in the blood vessels of the liver (portal hypertension) Kidney failure (hepatorenal syndrome) Liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) Mental confusion, change in the level of consciousness, or coma ( hepatic encephalopathy ) When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you: Develop symptoms of alcoholic liver disease Develop symptoms after a long period of heavy drinking Are worried that drinking may be harming your health Get emergency medical help right away if you have: Abdominal or chest pain Abdominal swelling or ascites that is new or suddenly becomes worse A fever (temperature greater than 101°F, or 38.3°C) Diarrhea New confusion or a change in alertness, or it gets worse Rectal bleeding, vomiting blood, or blood in the urine Shortness of breath Vomiting more than once a day Yellowing skin or eyes (jaundice) that is new or gets worse quickly Prevention Talk openly to your provider about your alcohol intake. The provider can counsel you about how much alcohol is safe for you.

Anterior vaginal wall repair is a surgical procedure. This surgery tightens the front ( anterior ) wall of the vagina. Description The anterior vaginal wall can sink (prolapse) or bulge. This occurs when the bladder or the urethra sink into the vagina. The repair may be done while you are under: General anesthesia : You will be asleep and unable to feel pain. Spinal anesthesia : You will be awake, but you will be numb from the waist down and you will not feel pain. You will be given medicines to help you relax. Your surgeon will: Make a surgical cut through the front wall of your vagina . Move your bladder back to its normal location. May fold your vagina, or cut away part of it. Put sutures (stitches) in the tissue between your vagina and bladder. These will hold the walls of your vagina in the correct position. Place a patch between your bladder and vagina. This patch can be made of commercially available biological material (cadaveric tissue). The FDA has banned use of synthetic material and animal tissue in the vagina to treat anterior vaginal wall prolapse. Attach sutures to the walls of the vagina to the tissue on the side of your pelvis. Why the Procedure is Performed This procedure is used to repair sinking or bulging of the anterior vaginal wall. Symptoms of anterior vaginal wall prolapse include: You may not be able to empty your bladder completely. Your bladder may feel full all the time. You may feel pressure in your vagina. You may be able to feel or see a bulging at the opening of the vagina. You may have pain when you have sex. You may leak urine when you cough, sneeze, or lift something. You may get bladder infections. This surgery by itself does not treat stress incontinence . Stress incontinence is the leaking of urine when you cough, sneeze, or lift. Surgery to correct stress urinary incontinence may be performed along with other surgeries. Before doing this surgery, your health care provider may have you: Learn pelvic floor muscle exercises ( Kegel exercises ) Use estrogen cream in your vagina Try a device called a pessary in your vagina to strengthen the muscle around the vagina Risks Risks for anesthesia and surgery in general are: Reactions to medicines Breathing problems Bleeding, blood clots Infection Risks for this procedure include: Damage to the urethra, bladder, or vagina Irritable bladder Changes in the vagina (prolapsed vagina) Urine leakage from the vagina or to the skin (fistula) Worsening urinary incontinence Lasting pain Complications from the material used during surgery (mesh/grafts) Before the Procedure Always tell your provider what drugs you are taking. Also tell the provider about the drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription that you are taking. During the days before the surgery: You may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other drugs that make it hard for your blood to clot. Ask your provider which drugs you should still take on the day of your surgery. On the day of your surgery: You very often will be asked not to drink or eat anything for 6 to 12 hours before the surgery. Take the medicines your provider told you to take with a small sip of water. Your provider will tell you when to arrive at the hospital. After the Procedure You may have a catheter to drain urine for 1 or 2 days after surgery. You will be on a liquid diet right after surgery. When your normal bowel function returns, you can return to your regular diet. You should not insert anything in the vagina, lift heavy items, or have sex until your surgeon says it is OK. Outlook (Prognosis) This surgery will very often repair the prolapse and the symptoms will go away. This improvement will often last for years.

The development of children ages 12 through 18 years old should include expected physical and mental milestones. Information During adolescence, children develop the ability to: Understand abstract ideas. These include grasping higher math concepts, and developing moral philosophies, including rights and privileges. Establish and maintain satisfying relationships. Adolescents will learn to share intimacy without feeling worried or inhibited. Move toward a more mature sense of themselves and their purpose. Question old values without losing their identity. PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT During adolescence, young people go through many changes as they move into physical maturity. Early, prepubescent changes occur when the secondary sexual characteristics appear. Girls: Girls may begin to develop breast buds as early as 8 years old. Breasts develop fully between ages 12 and 18. Pubic hair, armpit and leg hair usually begin to grow at about age 9 or 10, and reach adult patterns at about 13 to 14 years. Menarche (the beginning of menstrual periods) typically occurs about 2 years after early breast and pubic hair appear. It may occur as early as age 9, or as late as age 16. The average age of menstruation in the United States is about 12 years. Girls growth spurt peaks around age 11.5 and slows around age 16. Boys: Boys may begin to notice that their testicles and scrotum grow as early as age 9. Soon, the penis begins to lengthen. By age 17 or 18, their genitals are usually at their adult size and shape. Pubic hair growth, as well as armpit, leg, chest, and facial hair, begins in boys at about age 12, and reaches adult patterns at about 17 to 18 years. Boys do not start puberty with a sudden incident, like the beginning of menstrual periods in girls. Having regular nocturnal emissions (wet dreams) marks the beginning of puberty in boys. Wet dreams typically start between ages 13 and 17. The average age is about 14 and a half years. Boys' voices change at the same time as the penis grows. Nocturnal emissions occur with the peak of the height spurt. Boys' growth spurt peaks around age 13 and a half and slows around age 18. BEHAVIOR The sudden and rapid physical changes that adolescents go through make adolescents very self-conscious. They are sensitive, and worried about their own body changes. They may make painful comparisons about themselves with their peers. Physical changes may not occur in a smooth, regular schedule. Therefore, adolescents may go through awkward stages, both in their appearance and physical coordination. Girls may be anxious if they are not ready for the beginning of their menstrual periods. Boys may worry if they do not know about nocturnal emissions. During adolescence, it is normal for young people to begin to separate from their parents and make their own identity. In some cases, this may occur without a problem from their parents and other family members. However, this may lead to conflict in some families as the parents try to keep control. Friends become more important as adolescents pull away from their parents in a search for their own identity. Their peer group may become a safe haven. This allows the adolescent to test new ideas. In early adolescence, the peer group most often consists of non-romantic friendships. These often include "cliques," gangs, or clubs. Members of the peer group often try to act alike, dress alike, have secret codes or rituals, and participate in the same activities. As the youth moves into mid-adolescence (14 to 16 years) and beyond, the peer group expands to include romantic friendships. In mid- to late adolescence, young people often feel the need to establish their sexual identity. They need to become comfortable with their body and sexual feelings. Adolescents learn to express and receive intimate or sexual advances. Young people who do not have the chance for such experiences may have a harder time with intimate relationships when they are adults. Adolescents very often have behaviors that are consistent with several myths of adolescence: The first myth is that they are "on stage" and other people's attention is constantly centered on their appearance or actions. This is normal self-centeredness. However, it may appear (especially to adults) to border on paranoia, self-love (narcissism), or even hysteria. Another myth of adolescence is the idea that "it will never happen to me, only the other person." "It" may represent becoming pregnant or catching a sexually-transmitted disease after having unprotected sex, causing a car crash while driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or any of the many other negative effects of risk-taking behaviors. SAFETY Adolescents become stronger and more independent before they have developed good decision-making skills. A strong need for peer approval may tempt a young person to take part in risky behaviors. Motor vehicle safety should be stressed. It should focus on the role of the driver/passenger/pedestrian, the risks of substance abuse, and the importance of using seat belts. Adolescents should not have the privilege of using motor vehicles unless they can show that they can do so safely. Other safety issues are: Adolescents who are involved in sports should learn to use equipment and protective gear or clothing. They should be taught the rules of safe play and how to approach more advanced activities. Young people need to be very aware of possible dangers including sudden death. These threats can occur with regular substance abuse, and with the experimental use of drugs and alcohol. Adolescents who are allowed to use or have access to firearms need to learn how to use them properly. Adolescents may need to be evaluated if they appear to be isolated from their peers, uninterested in school or social activities, or doing poorly at school, work, or sports. Many adolescents are at increased risk for depression and potential suicide attempts. This can be due to pressures and conflicts in their family, school or social organizations, peer groups, and intimate relationships. If you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org . You can also call 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides free and confidential support 24/7, anytime day or night. You can also call 911 or the local emergency number or go to the hospital emergency room. DO NOT delay. If someone you know has attempted suicide, call 911 or the local emergency number right away. DO NOT leave the person alone, even after you have called for help. PARENTING TIPS ABOUT SEXUALITY Adolescents most often need privacy to understand the changes taking place in their bodies. Ideally, they should be allowed to have their own bedroom. If this is not possible, they should have at least some private space. Teasing an adolescent child about physical changes is inappropriate. It may lead to self-consciousness and embarrassment. Parents need to remember that it is natural and normal for their adolescent to be interested in body changes and sexual topics. It does not mean that their child is involved in sexual activity. Adolescents may experiment with a wide range of sexual orientations or behaviors before feeling comfortable with their own sexual identity. Parents must be careful not to call new behaviors "wrong," "sick," or "immoral." The Oedipal complex (a child's attraction to the parent of the opposite sex) is common during the adolescent years. Parents can deal with this by acknowledging the child's physical changes and attractiveness without crossing parent-child boundaries. Parents can also take pride in the youth's growth into maturity. It is normal for the parent to find the adolescent attractive. This often happens because the teen often looks very much like the other (same-sex) parent did at a younger age. This attraction may cause the parent to feel awkward. The parent should be careful not to create a distance that may make the adolescent feel responsible. It is inappropriate for a parent's attraction to a child to be anything more than an attraction as a parent. Attraction that crosses the parent-child boundaries may lead to inappropriately intimate behavior with the adolescent. This is known as incest. INDEPENDENCE AND POWER STRUGGLES The teenager's quest to become independent is a normal part of development. The parent should not see it as a rejection or loss of control. Parents need to be constant and consistent. They should be available to listen to the child's ideas without dominating the child's independent identity. Although adolescents always challenge authority figures, they need or want limits. Limits provide a safe boundary for them to grow and function. Limit-setting means having pre-set rules and regulations about their behavior. Power struggles begin when authority is at stake or "being right" is the main issue. These situations should be avoided, if possible. One of the parties (typically the teen) will be overpowered. This will cause the youth to lose face. The adolescent may feel embarrassed, inadequate, resentful, and bitter as a result. Parents should be ready for and recognize common conflicts that may develop while parenting adolescents. The experience may be affected by unresolved issues from the parent's own childhood, or from the adolescent's early years. Parents should know that their adolescents will repeatedly challenge their authority. Keeping open lines of communication and clear, yet negotiable, limits or boundaries may help reduce major conflicts. Most parents feel like they have more wisdom and self-growth as they rise to the challenges of parenting adolescents.

Allergic reactions are sensitivities to substances called allergens that come into contact with the skin, nose, eyes, respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal tract. They can be breathed into the lungs, swallowed, or injected. Considerations Allergic reactions are common. The immune response that causes an allergic reaction is similar to the response that causes hay fever. Most reactions happen soon after contact with an allergen. Many allergic reactions are mild, while others can be severe and life threatening. They can be confined to a small area of the body, or they may affect the entire body. The most severe form is called anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock. Allergic reactions occur more often in people who have a family history of allergies . Substances that don't bother most people (such as venom from bee stings and certain foods, medicines, and pollens) can trigger allergic reactions in certain people. First-time exposure may produce only a mild reaction. Repeated exposures may lead to more serious reactions. Once a person has had an exposure or an allergic reaction (and thus is sensitized to an allergen), even a very limited exposure to a very small amount of allergen can trigger a severe reaction. Most severe allergic reactions occur within seconds or minutes after exposure to the allergen. Some reactions can occur after several hours. In very rare cases, reactions develop after 24 hours. Anaphylaxis is a sudden and severe allergic reaction that occurs within minutes or hours of exposure. Immediate medical attention is needed for this condition. Without treatment, anaphylaxis can get worse very quickly and lead to death within 15 minutes. Causes Common allergens include: Animal dander Bee stings or stings from other insects such as fire ants Foods, especially milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish Medicines Pollens Symptoms Common symptoms of a mild allergic reaction include: A few hives (especially over the neck and face) Itching Nasal congestion Rashes Watery, red eyes Symptoms of a moderate or severe reaction include: Abdominal pain Abnormal (high-pitched) breathing sounds Anxiety Chest discomfort or tightness Cough Diarrhea Difficulty breathing, wheezing Difficulty swallowing Dizziness or lightheadedness Flushing or redness of the face Hives all over Nausea or vomiting Palpitations Swelling of the face, eyes, or tongue Unconsciousness First Aid For a mild to moderate reaction: Calm and reassure the person having the reaction. Anxiety can make symptoms worse. Try to identify the allergen and have the person avoid further contact with it. If the person develops an itchy rash, apply cool compresses and an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream. Watch the person for signs of increasing distress. Get medical help. For a mild reaction, a health care provider may recommend over-the-counter medicines, such as antihistamines. For a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis): Check the person's airway, breathing, and circulation (the ABC's of Basic Life Support). A warning sign of dangerous throat swelling is a very hoarse or whispered voice, or coarse sounds when the person is breathing in air. If necessary, begin rescue breathing and CPR . Call 911 or the local emergency number. Calm and reassure the person. If the allergic reaction is from a bee sting, scrape the stinger off the skin with something firm (such as a fingernail or plastic credit card). Do not use tweezers -- squeezing the stinger will release more venom. If the person has injectable emergency allergy medicine (Epinephrine), administer it at the beginning of a reaction. Do not wait to see if the reaction gets worse. Avoid oral medicine if the person is having difficulty breathing. Take steps to prevent shock . Have the person lie flat, raise the person's feet about 12 inches (30 centimeters), and cover them with a coat or blanket. Do not place the person in this position if a head, neck, back, or leg injury is suspected or if it causes discomfort. DO NOT If a person is having an allergic reaction: Do not assume that any allergy shots the person has already received will provide complete protection. Do not place a pillow under the person's head if he or she is having trouble breathing. This can block the airways. Do not give the person anything by mouth if the person is having trouble breathing. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact for medical assistance (911 or the local emergency number) right away if: The person is having a severe allergic reaction. Do not wait to see if the reaction is getting worse. The person has a history of severe allergic reactions (check for a medical ID tag). Prevention To prevent allergic reactions: Avoid triggers such as foods and medicines that have caused an allergic reaction in the past. Ask detailed questions about ingredients when you are eating away from home. Carefully check ingredient labels. If you have a child who is allergic to certain foods, introduce one new food at a time in small amounts so you can recognize an allergic reaction. People who have had serious allergic reactions should wear a medical ID tag and carry emergency such as a two-pack of injectable epinephrine, according to their provider's instructions. There is no contraindication to using epinephrine in a severe allergic reaction.

Anthrax is an infectious disease caused by a bacterium called Bacillus anthracis . Infection in humans most often involves the skin, gastrointestinal tract, or lungs. Causes Anthrax commonly affects hoofed animals such as sheep, cattle, and goats. Humans who come into contact with infected animals can get sick with anthrax as well. There are three main routes of anthrax infection: skin (cutaneous), lung (inhalation), and mouth (gastrointestinal). Cutaneous anthrax occurs when anthrax spores enter the body through a cut or scrape on the skin. It is the most common type of anthrax infection. The main risk is contact with animal hides or hair, bone products, and wool, or with infected animals. People most at risk for cutaneous anthrax include farm workers, veterinarians, tanners, and wool workers. Inhalation anthrax develops when anthrax spores enter the lungs through the airways. It is most commonly contracted when workers breathe in airborne anthrax spores during processes such as tanning hides and processing wool. Breathing in spores means a person has been exposed to anthrax. But it does not mean the person will have symptoms. The bacterial spores must germinate or sprout (the same way a seed sprouts before a plant grows) before the actual disease occurs. This process usually takes 1 to 6 days. Once the spores germinate, they release several toxic substances. These substances cause internal bleeding, swelling, and tissue death. Gastrointestinal anthrax occurs when someone eats anthrax-tainted meat. Injection anthrax can occur in someone who self-injects drugs (heroin). Anthrax may be used as a biological weapon or for bioterrorism. Symptoms Symptoms of anthrax differ, depending on the type of anthrax. Symptoms of cutaneous anthrax start 1 to 7 days after exposure: An itchy sore develops that is similar to an insect bite. This sore may blister and form a black ulcer (sore or eschar). The sore is usually painless, but it is often surrounded by swelling. A scab often forms, and then dries and falls off within 2 weeks. Complete healing can take longer. Symptoms of inhalation anthrax: Begins with fever, malaise , headache, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain Fever and shock may occur later Symptoms of gastrointestinal anthrax usually occur within 1 week and may include: Abdominal pain Bloody diarrhea Diarrhea Fever Mouth sores Nausea and vomiting (the vomit may contain blood) Symptoms of injection anthrax are similar to those of cutaneous anthrax. In addition, the skin or muscle beneath the injection site may get infected. Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical examination. The tests to diagnose anthrax depend on the type of disease that is suspected. A culture of the skin, and sometimes a biopsy , are done on the skin sores. The sample is looked at under a microscope to identify the anthrax bacterium. Tests may include: Blood culture Chest CT scan or chest x-ray Spinal tap to check for infection around the spinal column Sputum culture Complete blood count Blood chemistries More tests may be done on fluid or blood samples . Treatment Antibiotics are usually used to treat anthrax. Antibiotics that may be prescribed include penicillin, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin. Inhalation anthrax is treated with a combination of antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin plus another medicine. They are given by IV (intravenously). Antibiotics are usually taken for 60 days because it can take spores that long to germinate. Cutaneous anthrax is treated with antibiotics taken by mouth, usually for 7 to 10 days. Doxycycline and ciprofloxacin are most often used. Outlook (Prognosis) When treated with antibiotics, cutaneous anthrax is likely to get better. But some people who do not get treated may die if anthrax spreads to the blood. People with second-stage inhalation anthrax have a poor outlook, even with antibiotic therapy. Many cases in the second stage are fatal. Gastrointestinal anthrax infection can spread to the bloodstream and may result in death. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you think you have been exposed to anthrax or if you develop symptoms of any type of anthrax. Prevention There are two main ways to prevent anthrax: For people who have been exposed to anthrax (but have no symptoms of the disease), providers may prescribe preventive antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin, penicillin, or doxycycline, depending on the strain of anthrax. An anthrax vaccine is available to military personnel and some members of the general public. It is given in a series of 5 doses over 18 months. There is no known way to spread cutaneous anthrax from person to person. People who live with someone who has cutaneous anthrax do not need antibiotics unless they have also been exposed to the same source of anthrax.

An annular pancreas is a ring of pancreatic tissue that encircles the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). The normal position of the pancreas is next to, but not surrounding the duodenum. Causes Annular pancreas is problem present at birth (congenital defect). Symptoms occur when the ring of pancreas squeezes and narrows the small intestine so that food cannot pass easily or at all. Newborns may have symptoms of complete blockage of the intestine. However, up to one half of people with this condition do not have symptoms until adulthood. There are also cases that are not detected because the symptoms are mild. Conditions that may be associated with annular pancreas include: Down syndrome Excess amniotic fluid during pregnancy (polyhydramnios) Other congenital gastrointestinal problems Pancreatitis Symptoms Newborns may not feed well. They may spit up more than normal, not drink enough breast milk or formula, and cry. Adult symptoms may include: Abdominal pain Fullness after eating Nausea or vomiting Exams and Tests Tests include: Abdominal ultrasound Abdominal x-ray CT scan Upper GI and small bowel series Treatment Treatment most often involves surgery to bypass the blocked part of the duodenum. Outlook (Prognosis) The outcome is most often good with surgery. Adults with an annular pancreas are at increased risk for pancreatic or biliary tract cancer. Possible Complications Complications may include: Obstructive jaundice Pancreatic cancer Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) Peptic ulcer Perforation (tearing a hole) of the intestine due to obstruction Peritonitis When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your health care provider if you or your child has any symptoms of annular pancreas.

An abdominal wall fat pad biopsy is the removal of a small part of the abdominal wall fat pad for laboratory study of the tissue. How the Test is Performed Needle aspiration is the most common method of taking an abdominal wall fat pad biopsy. The health care provider cleans the skin on your belly area. Numbing medicine will be applied on or injected into the area. A needle is placed through the skin and into the fat pad under the skin. A small piece of the fat pad is removed with the needle. It is sent to a laboratory for analysis. How to Prepare for the Test No special preparation is usually necessary. However, follow any specific instructions your provider gives you. How the Test will Feel You may have some mild discomfort or feel pressure when the needle is inserted. Afterward, the area may feel tender or be bruised for several days. Why the Test is Performed The procedure is done most often to test for amyloidosis . Amyloidosis is a disorder in which abnormal proteins build up in tissues and organs, impairing their function. Clumps of the abnormal proteins are called amyloid deposits. Diagnosing the disease in this way may avoid the need for a biopsy of a nerve or an internal organ, which is a more difficult procedure. Normal Results The fat pad tissues are normal. What Abnormal Results Mean In the case of amyloidosis, abnormal results mean there are amyloid deposits. Risks There is a slight risk for infection, bruising, or slight bleeding.

Abdominal exploration is surgery to look at the organs and structures in your belly area (abdomen). This includes your: Appendix Bladder Gallbladder Intestines Kidney and ureters Liver Pancreas Spleen Stomach Uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries (in women) Surgery that opens the abdomen is called a laparotomy. Description Exploratory laparotomy is done while you are under general anesthesia. This means you are asleep and feel no pain. Your surgeon makes a cut into the abdomen and examines the abdominal organs. The size and location of the surgical cut depend on the specific health concern. A biopsy can be taken during the procedure. Laparoscopy describes a procedure that is performed with a tiny camera placed inside the abdomen. If possible, laparoscopy will be done instead of laparotomy. Why the Procedure is Performed Your health care provider may recommend a laparotomy if imaging tests of the abdomen, such as x-rays and CT scans , have not provided an accurate diagnosis. Exploratory laparotomy may be used to help diagnose and treat many health conditions, including: Cancer of the ovary, colon, pancreas, liver Endometriosis Gallstones Hole in the intestine (intestinal perforation) Acute appendicitis Diverticulitis Acute or chronic pancreatitis Liver abscess Pockets of infection (retroperitoneal abscess, abdominal abscess , pelvic abscess) Pregnancy outside of the uterus ( ectopic pregnancy ) Scar tissue in the abdomen ( adhesions ) Risks Risks of anesthesia and surgery in general include: Reactions to medicines Breathing problems Bleeding, blood clots, infection Risks of this surgery include: Incisional hernia Damage to organs in the abdomen Before the Procedure You will visit with your provider and have medical tests before your surgery. Your provider will: Do a complete physical exam. Make sure other medical conditions you may have, such as diabetes or high blood pressure , are under control. Perform tests to make sure that you will be able to tolerate the surgery. If you are a smoker, you should stop smoking several weeks before your surgery. Ask your provider for help. Tell your surgeon or nurse if: You are or could be pregnant You are taking any medicines, including drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription During the week before your surgery: You may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting. These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners. Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery. On the day of surgery: Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking. Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water. Arrive at the hospital on time. Outlook (Prognosis) You should be able to start eating and drinking normally about 2 to 3 days after the surgery. How long you stay in the hospital depends on the severity of the problem. Complete recovery usually takes about 4 to 6 weeks.

Your body shape changes naturally as you age. You cannot avoid some of these changes, but your lifestyle choices may slow or speed the process. The human body is made up of fat tissue, lean tissue (muscles and organs), bones, and water. After age 30, people tend to lose lean tissue. Your muscles, liver, kidney, and other organs may lose some of their cells. This process of muscle loss is called atrophy. Bones may lose some of their minerals and become less dense (a process that may lead to a condition called osteopenia in the early stages and osteoporosis in the later stages). Tissue loss reduces the amount of water in your body. The amount of body fat goes up steadily after age 30. Older people may have almost one third more fat compared to when they were younger. Fat tissue builds up toward the center of the body, including around the internal organs. However, the layer of fat under the skin gets smaller. The tendency to become shorter occurs among all races and both sexes. Height loss is related to aging changes in the bones, muscles, and joints. As people age, several things can cause height loss: The gel-like disks between the vertebrae in the spine dry out and flatten. This shortens the spaces between the vertebrae. Muscle loss and loss of core strength can lead to a more stooped posture. Feet tend to flatten with age. Osteoporosis can cause micro fractures in the spine. People typically lose almost one-half inch (about 1 centimeter) every 10 years after age 40. Height loss is even more rapid after age 70. You may lose a total of 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.5 centimeters) in height as you age. You can help lessen height loss by following a healthy diet, staying physically active, and preventing and treating bone loss. Smaller leg muscles and stiffer joints can make moving around harder. Excess body fat and changes in body shape can affect your balance. These body changes can make falls more likely. Changes in total body weight vary for men and women. Men often gain weight until about age 55, and then begin to lose weight later in life. This may be related to a drop in the male sex hormone testosterone. Women usually gain weight until age 65, and then begin to lose weight. Weight loss later in life occurs partly because fat replaces lean muscle tissue, and fat weighs less than muscle. Diet and exercise habits can play a large role in a person's weight changes over their lifetime. Your lifestyle choices affect how quickly the aging process takes place. Some things you can do to reduce age-related body changes are: Get regular exercise. Eat a healthy diet that includes fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and the right amounts of healthy fats. Limit your alcohol use. Avoid tobacco products and illicit drugs. References Shah K, Villareal DT. Obesity. In: Fillit HM, Rockwood K, Young J, eds.

White blood cells fight infections from bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other germs. One important type of white blood cell is the granulocyte, which is made in the bone marrow and travels in the blood throughout the body. Granulocytes sense infections, gather at sites of infection, and destroy the germs. When the body has too few granulocytes, the condition is called agranulocytosis. This makes it harder for the body to fight off germs. As a result, the person is more likely to get sick from infections. Causes Agranulocytosis may be caused by: Autoimmune disorders Bone marrow diseases, such as myelodysplasia or large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia Certain medicines used to treat diseases, including cancer Certain street drugs Poor nutrition Preparation for bone marrow transplant Problem with genes Symptoms Symptoms of this condition may include: Fever Chills Malaise General weakness Sore throat Mouth and throat ulcers Bone pain Pneumonia Shock Exams and Tests A white blood cell differential test will be done to measure the percentage of each type of white blood cell in your blood. Other tests to diagnose the condition may include: Bone marrow biopsy Biopsy of mouth ulcer Neutrophil antibody studies (blood test) Treatment Treatment depends on the cause of the low white blood cell count. For example, if a medicine is the cause, stopping or changing to another medicine may help. In other cases, medicines to help the body make more white blood cells will be used. Outlook (Prognosis) Treating or removing the cause often results in a good outcome. Prevention If you are having treatment or taking medicine that could cause agranulocytosis, your health care provider will use blood tests to monitor you.

The ACTH test measures the level of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the blood. ACTH is a hormone released from the pituitary gland at the base of the brain. How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed . How to Prepare for the Test Your health care provider will likely ask you to have the test done early in the morning. This is important because cortisol level varies throughout the day. You may also be told to stop taking medicines that can affect the test results. These medicines include glucocorticoids such as prednisone, hydrocortisone, or dexamethasone. Do not stop these medicines unless instructed by your provider. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed The main function of ACTH is to regulate the glucocorticoid (steroid) hormone cortisol. Cortisol is released by the adrenal gland . It regulates blood pressure, blood sugar, the immune system, and the response to stress. This test can help find the causes of certain hormone problems. Normal Results Normal values for a blood sample taken early in the morning are 9 to 52 pg/mL (2 to 11 pmol/L). Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean A higher-than-normal level of ACTH may indicate: Adrenal glands not producing enough cortisol ( Addison disease ) Adrenal glands not producing enough hormones ( congenital adrenal hyperplasia ) One or more of the endocrine glands are overactive or have formed a tumor ( multiple endocrine neoplasia type I ) Pituitary is making too much ACTH ( Cushing disease ), which is usually caused by a non-cancerous tumor of the pituitary gland Rare type of tumor (lung, thyroid, or pancreas) making too much ACTH ( ectopic Cushing syndrome ) A lower-than-normal level of ACTH may indicate: Glucocorticoid medicines are suppressing ACTH production (most common) Pituitary gland not producing enough hormones, such as ACTH ( hypopituitarism ) Tumor of the adrenal gland that produces too much cortisol A normal response after taking the low-dose dexamethasone suppression test Risks There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Multiple punctures to locate veins Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names Serum adrenocorticotropic hormone; Adrenocorticotropic hormone; Highly-sensitive ACTH Images Endocrine glands References Guber HA, Oprea M, Russell YX.

Most women will remain in the hospital for about 24 hours after delivery. This is an important time for you to rest, bond with your new baby, and get help with breastfeeding and newborn care. What to Expect after Delivery Right after delivery, your baby will likely be placed on your chest while a nurse evaluates your baby's transition. Transition is the period after birth when your baby's body is adjusting to being outside your womb. Some babies may need oxygen or extra nursing care to transition. A small number may need to be transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit for extra care. However, most new babies stay in the room with their mother. In the first hours after delivery, hold your baby and attempt skin-to-skin contact. This helps ensure optimal bonding and the smoothest possible transition. If you are planning to breastfeed, which is highly recommended, your baby will likely try to latch on. During this time, you will stay in the room where you had your baby. A nurse will: Monitor your blood pressure, heart rate, and the amount of vaginal bleeding Check to make sure your uterus is becoming firmer Contractions, Bleeding, and Pain Once you deliver, the heavy contractions are over. But your uterus still needs to contract to shrink back to its normal size and prevent heavy bleeding. Breastfeeding also helps the uterus contract. These contractions may be somewhat painful but they are important. As your uterus becomes firmer and smaller, you are less likely to have heavier bleeding. Blood flow should gradually decrease during your first day. You may notice a few smaller clots passing when your nurse presses on your uterus to check it. For some women, the bleeding does not slow down and may even become heavier. This may be caused by a small piece of placenta that remains in the lining of your uterus. Rarely a minor surgery is needed to remove it. Care of the Vagina and Perineum The area between your vagina and rectum is called the perineum. Even if you did not have a tear or an episiotomy, the area may be swollen and somewhat tender. To relieve pain or discomfort: Ask your nurses to apply ice packs right after you give birth. Using ice packs in the first 24 hours after birth decreases the swelling and helps with the pain. Take warm baths, but wait until 24 hours after you have given birth. Also, use clean linens and towels and make sure the bathtub is clean each time you use it. Take medicine like ibuprofen to relieve pain. Some women are worried about bowel movements after delivery or may be constipated. You may receive stool softeners. Passing urine may hurt during the first day. Most often this discomfort goes away in a day or so. Caring for Your Baby Holding and caring for your new infant is exciting. Most women feel that it makes up for the long journey of pregnancy and the pain and discomfort of labor. Nurses and breastfeeding specialists are available to answer questions and help you. Keeping your baby in the room with you helps you to bond with your new family member. If the baby must go to the nursery for health reasons, use this time and rest as much as you can. Taking care of a newborn is a full-time job and can be tiring. Some women feel sadness or an emotional letdown after delivery. These feelings are common and are nothing to feel ashamed about. Talk with your health care provider, nurses, and partner.

Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) is a protein produced by the liver and yolk sac of a developing baby during pregnancy. AFP levels go down soon after birth. It is likely that AFP has no normal function in adults. A test can be done to measure the amount of AFP in your blood. How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed. Most of the time, blood is typically drawn from a vein located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. How to Prepare for the Test You do not need to take any special steps to prepare. How the Test will Feel You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn. Why the Test is Performed Your health care provider may order this test to: Screen for problems in the baby during pregnancy. (The test is done as part of a larger set of blood tests called quadruple screen .) Diagnose certain liver disorders. Screen for and monitor some cancers. Normal Results The normal values in males or nonpregnant females is generally less than 40 micrograms/liter. The examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean Greater than normal levels of AFP may be due to: Cancer in testes , ovaries, biliary (liver secretion) tract, stomach, or pancreas Cirrhosis of the liver Liver cancer Malignant teratoma Recovery from hepatitis Problems during pregnancy Alternative Names Fetal alpha globulin; AFP Images Blood test Alpha fetoprotein - series References Driscoll DA, Simpson JL.

Aase syndrome is a rare disorder that involves anemia and certain joint and skeletal deformities. Causes Many cases of Aase syndrome occur without a known reason and are not passed down through families (inherited). However, some cases (45%) have been shown to be inherited. These are due to a change in 1 of 20 genes important for making protein correctly (the genes make ribosomal proteins). This condition is similar to Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and the two conditions should considered the same. A missing piece on chromosome 19 is found in some people with Diamond-Blackfan anemia. The anemia in Aase syndrome is caused by poor development of the bone marrow, which is where blood cells are formed. Symptoms Symptoms may include: Absent or small knuckles Cleft palate Deformed ears Droopy eyelids Inability to fully extend the joints from birth Narrow shoulders Pale skin Triple-jointed thumbs Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. Tests that may be done include: Bone marrow biopsy Complete blood count (CBC) Echocardiogram X-rays Treatment Treatment may involve blood transfusions in the first year of life to treat anemia. A steroid medicine called prednisone has also been used to treat anemia associated with Aase syndrome. However, it should only be used after reviewing the benefits and risks with a provider who has experience treating anemias. A bone marrow transplant may be necessary if other treatment fails. Outlook (Prognosis) The anemia tends to improve with age. Possible Complications Complications related to anemia include: Fatigue Decreased oxygen in the blood Weakness Heart problems can lead to a variety of complications, depending on the specific defect. Severe cases of Aase syndrome have been associated with stillbirth or early death. Prevention Genetic counseling is recommended if you have a family history of this syndrome and wish to become pregnant.

An autoimmune disorder occurs when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake. There are more than 80 autoimmune disorders. Causes The blood cells in the body's immune system help protect against harmful substances. Examples include bacteria, viruses, toxins , cancer cells, and blood and tissue from outside the body. These substances contain antigens. The immune system produces antibodies against these antigens that enable it to destroy these harmful substances. When you have an autoimmune disorder, your immune system does not distinguish between healthy tissue and potentially harmful antigens. As a result, your body sets off a reaction that destroys normal tissues. The exact cause of autoimmune disorders is unknown. One theory is that some microorganisms (such as bacteria or viruses) or drugs may trigger changes that confuse the immune system. This may happen more often in people who have genes that make them more prone to autoimmune disorders. An autoimmune disorder may result in: The destruction of body tissue Abnormal growth of an organ Changes in organ function An autoimmune disorder may affect one or more organ or tissue types. Areas often affected by autoimmune disorders include: Blood vessels Connective tissues Endocrine glands such as the thyroid or pancreas Joints Muscles Red blood cells Skin A person may have more than one autoimmune disorder at the same time. Common autoimmune disorders include: Addison disease Celiac disease - sprue (gluten-sensitive enteropathy) Dermatomyositis Graves disease Hashimoto thyroiditis Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis) Multiple sclerosis Myasthenia gravis Pernicious anemia Reactive arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis Sjögren syndrome Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) Type I diabetes Symptoms Symptoms will vary, based on the type and location of the faulty immune response. Common symptoms include: Fatigue Fever General ill feeling (malaise) Joint pain Rash Exams and Tests Your health care provider will do a physical exam. Signs depend on the type of disease. Tests that may be done to diagnose an autoimmune disorder include: Antinuclear antibody (ANA) tests Autoantibody tests Complete blood count (CBC) with white blood cell differential (CBC with WBC differential) Comprehensive metabolic panel C-reactive protein (CRP) Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) Urinalysis Treatment The goals of treatment are to: Control the autoimmune process Maintain your body's ability to fight disease Reduce symptoms Treatments will depend on your disease and symptoms. Types of treatments include: Supplements to replace a substance that the body lacks, such as thyroid hormone, vitamin B12, or insulin, due to the autoimmune disease Blood transfusions if blood is affected Physical therapy to help with movement if the bones, joints, or muscles are affected Many people take medicines to reduce the immune system's abnormal response. These are called immunosuppressive medicines. Examples include corticosteroids (such as prednisone) and nonsteroid drugs such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate, sirolimus, or tacrolimus. Targeted drugs such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers and Interleukin inhibitors can be used for some diseases. Outlook (Prognosis) The outcome depends on the disease. Most autoimmune diseases are chronic , but many can be controlled with treatment. Symptoms of autoimmune disorders can come and go. When symptoms get worse, it is called a flare-up. Possible Complications Complications depend on the disease. Medicines used to suppress the immune system can cause severe side effects, such as higher risk for infections. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you develop symptoms of an autoimmune disorder. Prevention There is no known prevention for most autoimmune disorders.

Albumin is a protein made by the liver. A serum albumin test measures the amount of this protein in the clear liquid portion of the blood. Albumin can also be measured in the urine . How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed. How to Prepare for the Test The health care provider may tell you to temporarily stop taking certain medicines that can affect the test. Drugs that can increase albumin levels include: Anabolic steroids Androgens Growth hormone Insulin Do not stop taking any of your medicines without talking to your provider first. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed Albumin helps move many small molecules through the blood, including bilirubin , calcium, progesterone, and some medicines. It plays an important role in keeping the fluid in the blood from leaking into the tissues. This test can help determine if you have liver disease or kidney disease, or if your body is not absorbing enough protein . Normal Results The normal range is 3.4 to 5.4 g/dL (34 to 54 g/L). Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean Lower-than-normal level of serum albumin may be a sign of: Kidney diseases Liver disease (for example, hepatitis or cirrhosis that may cause ascites [fluid buildup in the abdomen]) Decreased blood albumin may occur when your body does not get or absorb enough nutrients, such as with: After weight-loss surgery Celiac disease (damage of the lining of the small intestine due to eating gluten) Crohn disease (inflammation of the digestive tract) Low-protein diets Whipple disease (condition that prevents the small intestine from allowing nutrients to pass into the rest of the body) Increased blood albumin may be due to: Dehydration High protein diet Having a tourniquet on for a long time when giving a blood sample Drinking too much water (water intoxication) may also cause abnormal albumin results. Other conditions for which the test may be performed: Burns (widespread) Wilson disease (condition in which there is too much copper in the body) Risks There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Multiple punctures to locate veins Hematoma (blood collecting under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Considerations If you are receiving large amounts of intravenous fluids, the results of this test may be inaccurate. Albumin will be decreased during pregnancy. Images Blood test References McPherson RA. Specific proteins. In: McPherson RA, Pincus MR, eds.

The word anaerobic indicates "without oxygen." The term has many uses in medicine. Anaerobic bacteria are germs that can survive and grow where there is no oxygen. For example, they can thrive in human tissue that is injured and does not have oxygen-rich blood flowing to it. Infections like tetanus and gangrene are caused by anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic infections typically cause abscesses (buildups of pus), and death of tissue (necrosis). Many anaerobic bacteria produce enzymes that destroy tissue or sometimes release potent toxins. Besides bacteria, some protozoans and worms are also anaerobic. Illnesses that create a lack of oxygen in the body can force the body into anaerobic activity. This can cause harmful chemicals to form. It can happen in all types of shock. Anaerobic is the opposite of aerobic . In exercise, our bodies need to perform both anaerobic and aerobic chemical reactions to supply us with energy. We need aerobic reactions for slower and more prolonged exercise like walking or jogging. Anaerobic reactions are faster. We need them during shorter, more intense activities like sprinting. Anaerobic exercise leads to a buildup of lactic acid in our tissues. We need oxygen to remove the lactic acid. When sprinters breathe heavily after running a race, they are removing the lactic acid by providing oxygen to their bodies. Images Anaerobic organism References Asplund CA, Best TM.

Age-related hearing loss, or presbycusis, is the slow loss of hearing that occurs as people get older. Causes Tiny hair cells inside your inner ear help you hear. They pick up sound waves and change them into the nerve signals that your brain interprets as sound. Hearing loss occurs when the tiny hair cells are damaged or die. The hair cells do not regrow, so hearing loss caused by hair cell damage is permanent. There is no known single cause of age-related hearing loss. Most commonly, it is caused by changes in the inner ear that occur as you grow older. Your genes and loud noise (for example from loud concerts or music headphones) may play a role. The following factors contribute to age-related hearing loss: Family history (age-related hearing loss tends to run in families) Repeated exposure to loud noises Smoking (smokers are more likely to have such hearing loss than nonsmokers) Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes Certain medicines, such as chemotherapy drugs for cancer Symptoms Loss of hearing often occurs slowly over time. Symptoms include: Difficulty hearing people around you Having to raise the volume on the TV Frequently asking people to repeat themselves Frustration at not being able to hear Certain sounds seeming overly loud Problems hearing in noisy areas Problems telling apart certain sounds, such as "s" or "th" More difficulty understanding people with higher-pitched voices Ringing in the ears Talk to your health care provider if you have any of these symptoms. Exams and Tests Your provider will do a complete physical exam. This helps find if a medical problem is causing your hearing loss. Your provider will use an instrument called an otoscope to look in your ears. Sometimes, ear wax can block the ear canals and cause hearing loss. You may be sent to an ear, nose, and throat doctor and a hearing specialist (audiologist). Hearing tests can help determine the extent of hearing loss. Treatment There is no cure for age-related hearing loss. Treatment is focused on improving your everyday function . The following may be helpful: Hearing aids Telephone amplifiers and other assistive devices Sign language (for those with severe hearing loss) Speech reading (lip reading and using visual cues to aid communication) A cochlear implant may be recommended for people with severe hearing loss. Surgery is done to place the implant. The implant allows the person to detect sounds again and with practice can allow the person to understand speech, but it does not restore normal hearing. Outlook (Prognosis) Age-related hearing loss most often gets worse slowly. The hearing loss cannot be reversed and may lead to deafness. Hearing loss may cause you to avoid leaving home. Seek help from your provider and family and friends to avoid becoming isolated. Hearing loss can be managed so that you can continue to live a full and active life. Possible Complications Hearing loss can result in both physical (for example not hearing a fire alarm) and psychological (such as social isolation) problems. The hearing loss may lead to deafness . When to Contact a Medical Professional Hearing loss should be checked as soon as possible. This helps rule out causes such as too much wax in the ear or side effects of medicines. Your provider should have you get a hearing test.

Amniotic band sequence (ABS) is a group of rare birth defects that are thought to occur when strands of the amniotic sac detach and wrap around parts of the baby in the womb. The defects may affect the abdomen or chest as well as the face, arms, legs, fingers, or toes and may cause amputation. Causes Amniotic bands are thought to be caused by damage to a part of the placenta called the amnion (or amniotic membrane). The placenta carries blood to a baby still growing in the womb. Damage to the placenta can prevent normal growth and development. Damage to the amnion may produce fiber-like bands that can trap, compress, or amputate parts of the developing baby. These bands reduce blood supply to the areas and cause them to develop abnormally. However, some cases of ABS deformity may be caused by reduced blood supply without any signs of bands or damage to the amnion. There have also been rare cases that seem to be due to genetic defects. Symptoms The severity of the deformity can vary widely, from a small dent in a toe or finger to an entire body part missing or being severely underdeveloped. Symptoms may include: Abnormal gap in the head or face (if it goes across the face, it is called a cleft) All or part of a finger, toe, arm or leg missing (congenital amputation) Defect (cleft or hole) of the abdomen or chest wall (if band is located in those areas) Permanent band or indentation around an arm, leg, finger, or toe Exams and Tests The health care provider can diagnose this condition during prenatal ultrasound, if it is severe enough, or during a newborn physical exam. Treatment Treatment varies widely. Often, the deformity is not severe and no treatment is needed. Surgery while the baby is in the womb is being studied and may help improve outcomes in rare cases. Some cases improve or resolve prior to birth. In more serious cases, major surgery may be needed to reconstruct all or some of a body part. Some cases are so severe that they cannot be repaired. Plans should be made for careful delivery and management of the problem after birth. The baby should be delivered in a medical center that has specialists experienced in caring for babies with this condition. Outlook (Prognosis) How well the infant does depends on the severity of the condition. Most cases are mild and the outlook for normal function is excellent. More severe cases have more guarded outcomes. Possible Complications Complications can include complete or partial loss of function of a body part. Congenital bands affecting large parts of the body or umbilical cord cause the most problems. Some cases are so severe that they cannot be repaired.

Endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is surgery to repair a widened area in your aorta. This is called an aneurysm. The aorta is the large artery that carries blood to your belly, pelvis, and legs. When You're in the Hospital You had an endovascular aortic surgery repair for an aneurysm (a widened part) of the large artery that carries blood to your lower body (aorta). To perform the procedure: Your doctor made a small incision (cut) near your groin to find your femoral artery. A large tube was inserted into the artery so that other instruments could be inserted. An incision may have been made in the other groin as well as the arm. Your doctor inserted a stent and a man-made (synthetic) graft through the incision into the artery. X-rays were used to guide the stent and graft into your aorta where the aneurysm was located. The graft and stent were opened up and attached to the walls of the aorta. What to Expect at Home The cut in your groin may be sore for several days. You should be able to walk farther now without needing to rest. But you should take it easy at first. It may take 6 to 8 weeks to fully recover. You may feel discomfort in your abdomen for a few days. You may also have a loss of appetite. This will get better over the next week. You may have constipation or diarrhea for a short time. Self-care You will need to increase your activity slowly while the incision heals. Walking short distances on a flat surface is OK. Try to walk a little, 3 or 4 times a day. Slowly increase how far you walk each time. Limit going up and down stairs to about 2 times a day for the first 2 to 3 days after the procedure. Do not do yard work, drive, or play sports for at least 2 days, or for the number of days your doctor tells you to wait. Do not lift anything heavier than 10 pounds (4.5 kg) for 2 weeks after the procedure. You will need to take care of your incision. Your doctor will tell you how often to change your dressing. If your incision bleeds or swells, lie down and put pressure on it for 30 minutes, and call your provider. When you are resting, try keeping your legs raised above the level of your heart. Place pillows or blankets under your legs to raise them. Ask your health care provider about follow-up x-rays you will need to have to check if your new graft is OK. Having regular checkups to make sure your graft is working well is a very important part of your care. Your provider may ask you to take aspirin or another medicine called clopidogrel (Plavix) when you go home. These medicines are antiplatelet agents. They prevent the platelets in your blood from clumping together and forming clots in your arteries or stent. Do not stop taking them without talking with your provider first. Lifestyle Changes Endovascular surgery does not cure the underlying problem with your blood vessels. Other blood vessels could be affected in the future. Therefore, it is important to make the lifestyle changes and take the medicines your provider recommends. Eat a heart-healthy diet. Get regular exercise. Stop smoking (if you smoke). Take all medicines your provider has prescribed as directed. This may include medicines to lower cholesterol, manage high blood pressure, and treat diabetes. When to Call the Doctor Contact your doctor or provider if: You have pain in your belly or back that does not go away or is very bad. There is bleeding at the catheter insertion site that does not stop when pressure is applied. There is swelling at the catheter site. Your leg or arm below where the catheter was inserted changes color, becomes cool to the touch, pale, or numb. The small incision for your catheter becomes red or painful. Yellow or green discharge is draining from the incision for your catheter. Your legs are swelling. You have chest pain or shortness of breath that does not go away with rest. You have dizziness or fainting, or you are very tired. You are coughing up blood, or yellow or green mucus. You have chills or a fever over 101°F (38.3°C). You have blood in your stool. Your urine becomes dark colored or you do not urinate as much as usual. You are not able to move your legs. Your belly starts to swell and is painful.

Pneumonia is inflamed or swollen lung tissue due to infection with a germ. With atypical pneumonia, the infection is caused by different bacteria than the more common ones that cause pneumonia. Atypical pneumonia also tends to have milder symptoms than typical pneumonia. Causes Bacteria that cause atypical pneumonia include: Pneumonia caused by the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae often affects people younger than age 40. Pneumonia due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae bacteria occurs year round. Pneumonia due to Legionella pneumophila bacteria is seen more often in middle-aged and older adults, smokers, and those with chronic illnesses or a weak immune system. It can be more severe. This type of pneumonia is also called Legionnaire disease . Symptoms Pneumonia due to mycoplasma and chlamydophila bacteria is usually mild. Pneumonia due to legionella gets worse during the first 4 to 6 days, and then improves over 4 to 5 days. The most common symptoms of pneumonia are: Chills Cough (with legionella pneumonia, you may cough up bloody mucus) Fever, which may be mild or high Shortness of breath (may only occur when you exert yourself) Other symptoms include: Chest pain that gets worse when you breathe deeply or cough Confusion, most often in older people or those with legionella pneumonia Headache Loss of appetite, low energy, and fatigue Muscle aches and joint stiffness Sweating and clammy skin Less common symptoms include: Diarrhea (often with legionella pneumonia) Ear pain (with mycoplasma pneumonia) Eye pain or soreness (with mycoplasma pneumonia) Neck lump (with mycoplasma pneumonia) Rash (with mycoplasma pneumonia) Sore throat (with mycoplasma pneumonia) Exams and Tests People with suspected pneumonia should have a complete medical evaluation. It may be hard for your health care provider to tell whether you have pneumonia, bronchitis , or another respiratory infection, so you may need a chest x-ray . The evaluation is similar for people who have more typical pneumonia. Depending on how severe the symptoms are, other tests may be done, including: Complete blood count (CBC) Blood tests to identify the specific bacteria Bronchoscopy (rarely needed) CT scan of the chest Measuring levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood ( arterial blood gases ) Nose or throat swab to check for bacteria and viruses Blood cultures Open lung biopsy (only done in very serious illnesses when the diagnosis cannot be made from other sources) Sputum culture to identify the specific bacteria Urine test to check for legionella bacteria Treatment To feel better, you can take these self-care measures at home: Control your fever with aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen or naproxen), or acetaminophen. DO NOT give aspirin to children because it may cause a dangerous illness called Reye syndrome . DO NOT take cough medicines without first talking to your provider. Cough medicines may make it harder for your body to cough up the extra sputum. Drink plenty of fluids to help loosen secretions and bring up phlegm. Get a lot of rest. Have someone else do household chores. If needed, you will be prescribed antibiotics. You may be able to take antibiotics by mouth at home. If your condition is severe, you will likely be admitted to a hospital. There, you will be given antibiotics through a vein (intravenously), as well as oxygen. Antibiotics might be used for 2 weeks or more, although fewer days are usually enough. Finish all the antibiotics you've been prescribed, even if you feel better. If you stop the medicine too soon, the pneumonia can return and may be harder to treat. Outlook (Prognosis) Most people with pneumonia due to mycoplasma or chlamydophila get better with the right antibiotics. Legionella pneumonia can be severe. It can lead to problems, most often in those with kidney failure, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or a weakened immune system. It can also lead to death. Possible Complications Complications that may result include any of the following: Brain and nervous system infections, such as meningitis , myelitis, and encephalitis Hemolytic anemia , a condition in which there are not enough red blood cells in the blood because the body is destroying them Severe lung damage Respiratory failure requiring breathing machine support (ventilator) When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you develop fever, cough, or shortness of breath. There are many causes for these symptoms. The provider will need to rule out pneumonia. Also, call if you have been diagnosed with this type of pneumonia and your symptoms become worse after improving first. Prevention Wash your hands often and have other people around you do the same. Avoid contact with sick people whenever possible. If your immune system is weak, stay away from crowds. Ask visitors who have a cold to wear a mask. DO NOT smoke. If you do, get help to quit. Get appropriate vaccines like flu and COVID-19 shot as prescribed. Ask your provider if you need a pneumonia vaccine .

Arterial embolism refers to a clot (embolus) that has come from another part of the body and causes a sudden interruption of blood flow to an organ or body part. Causes An "embolus" is a blood clot or a piece of atherosclerotic plaque that acts like a clot. The word "emboli" means there is more than one clot or piece of plaque. When the clot travels from the site where it formed to another location in the body, it is called an embolism. An arterial embolism may be caused by one or more clots. The clots can get stuck in an artery and block blood flow. The blockage starves tissues of blood and oxygen. This can result in damage or tissue death ( necrosis ). Arterial emboli often occur in the legs and feet. Emboli that occur in the brain cause a stroke . Ones that occur in the heart cause a heart attack . Other sites include the kidneys, intestines, and eyes. Risk factors for arterial embolism include: Abnormal heart rhythms such as atrial fibrillation Injury or damage to an artery wall Conditions that increase blood clotting Another condition that poses a high risk for embolization (especially to the brain) is mitral stenosis . Endocarditis (infection of the inside of the heart) can also cause arterial emboli. A common source for an embolus is from areas of hardening (atherosclerosis causing plaque) in the aorta and other large blood vessels. These clots can break loose and flow down to the abdominal organs, legs and feet. Paradoxical embolization can take place when a clot in a vein enters the right side of the heart and passes through a hole into the left side of the heart. The clot can then move to an artery and block blood flow to the brain (stroke) or other organs. If a clot travels and lodges in the arteries supplying blood flow to the lungs, it is called a pulmonary embolus . Symptoms You may not have any symptoms. Symptoms may begin quickly or slowly depending on the size of the embolus and how much it blocks the blood flow. Symptoms of an arterial embolism in the arms or legs may include: Cold arm or leg Decreased or no pulse in an arm or leg Lack of movement in the arm or leg Pain in the affected area Numbness and tingling in the arm or leg Pale color of the arm or leg (pallor) Weakness of an arm or leg Later symptoms: Blisters of the skin fed by the affected artery Shedding (sloughing) of skin Skin erosion ( ulcer ) Tissue death (necrosis; skin is dark and damaged) Symptoms of a clot in an organ vary with the organ involved but may include: Pain in the part of the body that is involved Temporarily decreased organ function Exams and Tests The health care provider may find decreased or no pulse, and decreased or no blood pressure in the arm or leg. There may be signs of tissue death or gangrene. Tests to diagnose arterial embolism or reveal the source of emboli may include: Angiography of the affected extremity or organ Doppler ultrasound exam of an extremity Duplex Doppler ultrasound exam of an extremity Duplex Doppler ultrasound exam of arteries to the brain Echocardiogram MRI of the arm or leg Myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) Plethysmography Transcranial Doppler exam of arteries to the brain Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) This disease may also affect the results of the following tests: D-dimer Factor VIII assay Isotope study of the affected organ Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity Platelet aggregation test Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) levels Treatment Arterial embolism requires prompt treatment at a hospital. The goals of treatment are to control symptoms and to improve the interrupted blood flow to the affected area of the body. The cause of the clot, if found, should be treated to prevent further problems. Medicines include: Anticoagulants (such as warfarin or heparin or one of the newer blood thinners such as apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or dabigatran) can prevent new clots from forming Antiplatelet medicines (such as aspirin or clopidogrel) can prevent new clots from forming Painkillers given through a vein (by IV) Thrombolytics (such as streptokinase or tissue-type plasminogen activator) can dissolve clots Some people need surgery. Procedures include: Bypass of the artery (arterial bypass) to create a second source of blood supply Clot removal through a balloon catheter placed into the affected artery or through open surgery on the artery (embolectomy) Opening of the artery with a balloon catheter (angioplasty) with or without a stent Outlook (Prognosis) How well a person does depends on the location of the clot and how much the clot has blocked blood flow and for how long the blockage has been present. Arterial embolism can be very serious if not treated promptly. The affected area can be permanently damaged. Amputation is needed in up to 1 in 4 cases. Arterial emboli can come back even after successful treatment. Possible Complications Complications may include: Acute MI (heart attack) Infection in the affected tissue Septic shock Stroke (CVA) Temporary or permanent decrease or loss of other organ functions Temporary or permanent kidney failure Tissue death ( necrosis ) and gangrene Transient ischemic attack (TIA) When to Contact a Medical Professional Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have symptoms of arterial embolism. Prevention Prevention begins with finding possible sources of a blood clot. Your provider may prescribe blood thinners (such as warfarin or heparin) to prevent clots from forming. Antiplatelet drugs may also be needed. You have a higher risk atherosclerosis and clots if you: Smoke Do little exercise Have high blood pressure Have abnormal cholesterol levels Have diabetes Are overweight Are stressed Images Arterial embolism Circulatory system References Aufderheide TP.

Almost all children have abdominal pain at one time or another. Abdominal pain is pain in the stomach or belly area. It can be anywhere between the chest and groin. Most of the time, it is not caused by a serious medical problem. But sometimes abdominal pain can be a sign of something serious. Learn when you should seek medical care right away for your child with abdominal pain. Considerations When your child complains of abdominal pain, see if they can describe it to you. Here are different kinds of pain: Generalized pain or pain over more than half of the belly. Your child can have this kind of pain when they have a stomach virus, indigestion, gas, or when they become constipated. Cramp-like pain is likely to be due to gas and bloating. It is often followed by diarrhea. It is usually not serious. Colicky pain is pain that comes in waves, usually starts and ends suddenly, and is often severe. Localized pain is pain in only one area of the belly. Your child may be having problems with their appendix, gallbladder, a hernia (twisted bowel), ovary, testicles, or stomach (ulcers). If you have an infant or toddler, your child depends on you seeing that they are in pain. Suspect abdominal pain if your child is: More fussy than usual Drawing their legs up toward the belly Eating poorly Causes Your child could have abdominal pain for many reasons. It can be hard to know what is going on when your child has abdominal pain. Most of the time, there is nothing seriously wrong. But sometimes, it can be a sign that there is something serious and your child needs medical care. Your child most likely is having abdominal pain from something that is not life threatening. For example, your child may have: Air swallowing Abdominal migraine Colic Constipation Gas Food allergy or intolerance Food poisoning Heartburn or acid reflux Ingesting grass or plants Mononucleosis ("mono") Stomach flu Strep throat Pain caused by anxiety or depression Your child may have something more serious if the pain does not get better in 24 hours, gets worse or gets more frequent. Abdominal pain can be a sign of: Accidental poisoning Appendicitis Gallstones Hernia or other bowel twisting, blockage, or obstruction Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis) Intussusception, caused by part of the intestine being pulled inward into itself Pregnancy Sickle cell disease crisis Stomach ulcer Swallowed foreign bodies, especially coins or other solid objects Torsion (twisting) of the ovary Torsion (twisting) of the testicle Tumor or cancer Unusual inherited metabolic disorders (such as abnormal accumulation of protein and sugar breakdown products) Urinary tract infection Home Care Most of the time, you can use home care remedies and wait for your child to get better. If you are worried or your child's pain is getting worse, or the pain lasts longer than 24 hours, contact your health care provider. Have your child lie quietly to see if the abdominal pain goes away. Offer sips of water or other clear fluids. Suggest that your child try to pass stool. Avoid solid foods for a few hours. Then try small amounts of mild foods such as rice, applesauce, or crackers. Do not give your child foods or drinks that are irritating to the stomach. Avoid: Caffeine Carbonated beverages Citrus Dairy products Fried or greasy foods High-fat foods Tomato products Do not give aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen (Tylenol), or similar medicines without first asking your child's provider. To prevent many types of abdominal pain: Avoid fatty or greasy foods. Drink plenty of water each day. Eat small meals more often. Exercise regularly. Limit foods that produce gas. Make sure that meals are well-balanced and high in fiber. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. To reduce the risk of accidental poisoning and ingestion of foreign bodies: Keep all cleaning supplies and hazardous materials in their original containers. Store these dangerous items where infants and children cannot reach them. Do not allow infants and young children to play with objects they can easily swallow. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if the abdominal pain does not go away in 24 hours. Seek medical help right away or call your local emergency number (such as 911) if your child: Is a baby younger than 3 months and has diarrhea or vomiting Is currently being treated for cancer Is unable to pass stool, especially if your child is also vomiting Is vomiting blood or has blood in the stool (especially if the blood is maroon or a dark, tarry black color) Has sudden, sharp abdominal pain Has a rigid, hard belly Has had a recent injury to the abdomen Is having trouble breathing Contact your provider if your child has: Abdominal pain that lasts 1 week or longer, even if it comes and goes. Abdominal pain that does not improve in 24 hours. Contact your provider if it is getting more severe and frequent, or if your child is nauseous and vomiting with it. A burning sensation during urination. Diarrhea for more than 2 days. Vomiting for more than 12 hours. Fever over 100.4°F (38°C). Poor appetite for more than 2 days. Unexplained weight loss. What to Expect at Your Office Visit Talk to your provider about the location of the pain and its time pattern. Let your provider know if there are other symptoms like fever, fatigue, general ill feeling, change in behavior, nausea, vomiting, or changes in stool. Your provider may ask the questions about the abdominal pain: What part of the stomach hurts? All over? Lower or upper? Right, left, or middle? Around the navel? Is the pain sharp or cramping, constant or comes and goes, or changes in intensity over minutes? Does the pain wake your child up at night? Has your child had similar pain in the past? How long has each episode lasted? How often has it occurred? Is the pain getting more severe? Does the pain get worse after eating or drinking? After eating greasy foods, milk products, or carbonated drinks? Has your child started eating something new? Does the pain get better after eating or having a bowel movement? Does the pain get worse after stress? Has there been a recent injury? What other symptoms are occurring at the same time? During the physical examination, your provider will test to see if the pain is in a single area (point tenderness) or whether it is spread out. They may do some tests to check on the cause of the pain. The tests may include: Blood, urine, and stool tests CT (computerized tomography, or advanced imaging) scan Ultrasound (sound wave examination) of the abdomen X-rays of the abdomen and chest Alternative Names Stomach pain in children; Pain - abdomen - children; Abdominal cramps in children; Belly ache in children References Maqbool A, Liacouras CA.

You had surgery to treat your gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ). GERD is a condition that causes food or liquid to come up from your stomach into your esophagus (the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach). Now that you're going home, be sure to follow your surgeon's instructions on how to take care of yourself. When You're in the Hospital If you had a hiatal hernia , it was repaired. A hiatal hernia develops when the natural opening in your diaphragm is too large. Your diaphragm is the muscle between your chest and belly. Your stomach may bulge through this large hole into your chest. This bulging is called a hiatal hernia. It may make GERD symptoms worse. Your surgeon also wrapped the upper part of your stomach around the end of your esophagus to create pressure at the end of your esophagus. This pressure helps prevent stomach acid and food from flowing back up. Your surgery was done by making a large incision in your upper belly (open surgery) or with a small incision using a laparoscope (a thin tube with a tiny camera on the end). What to Expect at Home Most people go back to work 2 to 3 weeks after laparoscopic surgery and 4 to 6 weeks after open surgery. You may have a feeling of tightness when you swallow for 6 to 8 weeks. This is from the swelling inside your esophagus. You may also have some bloating. Self-care When you return home, you will be drinking a clear liquid diet for 2 weeks. You will be on a full liquid diet for about 2 weeks after that, and then a soft-food diet. On the liquid diet: Start off with small amounts of liquid, about 1 cup (237 mL) at a time. Sip. Do not gulp. Drink liquids often during the day after surgery. Avoid cold liquids. Do not drink carbonated beverages. Do not drink through straws (they can bring air into your stomach). Crush pills and take them with liquids for the first month after surgery. When you are eating solid foods again, chew well. Do not eat cold foods. Do not eat foods that clump together, such as rice or bread. Eat small amounts of food several times a day instead of three big meals. Your surgeon will give you a prescription for pain medicine. Get it filled when you go home so you have it when you need it. Take your pain medicine before your pain becomes too severe. If you have gas pains, try walking around to ease them. Do not drive, operate any machinery, or drink alcohol when you are taking narcotic pain medicine. This medicine can make you very drowsy and driving or using machinery is not safe. Walk several times a day. Do not lift anything heavier than 10 pounds (about a gallon of milk; 4.5 kg). Do not do any pushing or pulling. Slowly increase how much you do around the house. Your surgeon will tell you when you can increase your activity and return to work. Wound Care Take care of your wound (incision): If sutures (stitches), staples, or glue were used to close your skin, you may remove the wound dressings (bandages) and take a shower the day after surgery. If tape strips were used to close your skin, cover the wounds with plastic wrap before showering for the first week. Tape the edges of the plastic carefully to keep water out. Do not try to wash the strips off. They will fall off on their own after about a week. Do not soak in a bathtub or hot tub, or go swimming, until your doctor tells you it is OK. When to Call the Doctor Contact your health care provider if you have any of the following: Temperature of 101°F (38.3°C) or higher Incisions are bleeding, red, warm to the touch, or have a thick, yellow, green, or milky drainage Belly swells or hurts Nausea or vomiting for more than 24 hours Problems swallowing that keep you from eating Problems swallowing that do not go away after 2 or 3 weeks Pain medicine is not helping your pain Trouble breathing Cough that does not go away Can't drink or eat Skin or the white part of your eyes turns yellow Alternative Names Fundoplication - discharge; Nissen fundoplication - discharge; Belsey (Mark IV) fundoplication - discharge; Toupet fundoplication - discharge; Thal fundoplication - discharge; Hiatal hernia repair - discharge; Endoluminal fundoplication - discharge; GERD - fundoplication discharge; Gastroesophageal reflux disease - fundoplication discharge References Katz PO, Dunbar KB, Schnoll-Sussman FH, Greer KB, Yadlapati R, Spechler SJ.

Angioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to your legs. Fatty deposits can build up inside the arteries and block blood flow. A stent is a small, metal mesh tube that keeps the artery open. Angioplasty and stent placement are two ways to open blocked peripheral arteries. Description Angioplasty uses a medical "balloon" to widen blocked arteries. The balloon presses against the inside wall of the artery to open the space and improve blood flow. A metal stent is often placed across the artery wall to keep the artery from narrowing again. To treat a blockage, angioplasty can be done in the following locations: Aorta, the main artery that comes from your heart Artery in your hip or pelvis Artery in your thigh Artery behind your knee Artery in your lower leg Before the procedure: You will be given medicine to help you relax. You will be awake, but sleepy. You may also be given blood-thinning medicine to keep a blood clot from forming. You will lie down on your back on a padded operating table. Your surgeon will inject some numbing medicine into the area that will be treated, so that you do not feel pain. This is called local anesthesia. Your surgeon will then place a tiny needle into the blood vessel in your groin. A tiny flexible wire will be inserted through this needle. Your surgeon will be able to see your artery with live x-ray pictures. Dye will be injected into your body to show blood flow through your arteries. The dye will make it easier to see the blocked area. Your surgeon will guide a thin tube called a catheter through your artery to the blocked area. Next, your surgeon will pass a guide wire through the catheter to the blockage. The surgeon will push another catheter with a very small balloon on the end over the guide wire and into the blocked area. The balloon is then filled with contrast fluid to inflate the balloon. This opens the blocked vessel and restores blood flow to your heart. A stent may also be placed in the blocked area. The stent is inserted at the same time as the balloon catheter. It expands when the balloon is blown up. The stent is left in place to help keep the artery open. The balloon and all the wires are then removed. Why the Procedure is Performed Symptoms of a blocked peripheral artery are pain, achiness, or heaviness in your leg that starts or gets worse when you walk. You may not need this procedure if you can still do most of your everyday activities. Your health care provider may have you try medicines and other treatments first. Reasons for having this surgery are: You have symptoms that keep you from doing daily tasks that do not get better with other treatment. You have skin ulcers or wounds on the leg that do not get better. You have an infection or gangrene on the leg. You have pain in your leg caused by narrowed arteries, even when you are resting. Before having angioplasty, you will have special tests to see the extent of the blockage in your blood vessels. Risks Risks of angioplasty and stent placement are: Allergic reaction to the drug used in a stent that releases medicine into your body Allergic reaction to the x-ray dye Bleeding or clotting in the area where the catheter was inserted Blood clot in the legs or the lungs Damage to a blood vessel Damage to a nerve, which could cause pain or numbness in the leg Damage to the artery in the groin, which may need urgent surgery Heart attack Infection in the surgical cut Kidney failure (higher risk in people who already have kidney problems) Misplacement of the stent Stroke (this is rare) Failure to open the affected artery Loss of limb Before the Procedure During the 2 weeks before surgery: Tell your provider what medicines you are taking, even drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription. Tell your provider if you are allergic to seafood, if you have had a bad reaction to contrast material (dye) or iodine in the past, or if you are or could be pregnant. Tell your provider if you are taking sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), or tadalafil (Cialis). Tell your provider if you have been drinking a lot of alcohol (more than 1 or 2 drinks a day). You may need to stop taking drugs that make it harder for your blood to clot 2 weeks before surgery. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), clopidogrel (Plavix), Naprosyn (Aleve, Naproxen), and other medicines like these. Ask which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery. If you smoke, you must stop. Ask your provider for help. Always let your provider know about any cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness you may have before your surgery. Do not drink anything after midnight the night before your surgery, including water. On the day of your surgery: Take the medicines your provider told you to take with a small sip of water. You will be told when to arrive at the hospital. After the Procedure Many people are able to go home from the hospital in 2 days or less. Some people may not even have to stay overnight. You should be able to walk around within 6 to 8 hours after the procedure. Your provider will explain how to take care of yourself. Outlook (Prognosis) Angioplasty improves artery blood flow for most people. Results will vary, depending on where your blockage was, the size of your blood vessel, and how much blockage there is in other arteries. You may not need open bypass surgery if you have angioplasty. If the procedure does not help, your surgeon may need to do open bypass surgery, or even amputation.

Arthritis is inflammation or degeneration of one or more joints. A joint is the area where 2 bones meet. There are more than 100 different types of arthritis. Causes Arthritis involves the breakdown of structures of the joint, particularly cartilage. Normal cartilage protects a joint and allows it to move smoothly. Cartilage also absorbs shock when pressure is placed on the joint, such as when you walk. Without the normal amount of cartilage, the bones under the cartilage become damaged and rub together. This causes swelling (inflammation), and stiffness. Other joint structures affected by arthritis include: The synovium The bone next to the joint Ligaments and tendons Sacs that may be fluid-filled next to bone, ligaments and tendons (bursae) Joint inflammation and damage may result from: An autoimmune disease (the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue) Broken bone General "wear and tear" on joints Infection, most often by bacteria or viruses Crystals such as uric acid or calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate In most cases, the joint inflammation goes away after the cause goes away or is treated. Sometimes, it does not. When this happens, you have long-term (chronic) arthritis. Arthritis may occur in people of any age and sex. Osteoarthritis , which is due to non-inflammatory processes and increases with age, is the most common type. Other, more common types of inflammatory arthritis include: Ankylosing spondylitis Crystal arthritis, gout, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (in children) Bacterial infections Psoriatic arthritis Reactive arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis (in adults) Scleroderma Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) Symptoms Arthritis causes joint pain, swelling, stiffness, and limited movement. Symptoms can include: Joint pain Joint swelling Joint deformity Reduced ability to move the joint Redness and warmth of the skin around a joint Joint stiffness, especially in the morning Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your medical history. The physical exam may show: Fluid in or around a joint Warm, red, tender joints Difficulty moving a joint (called "limited range of motion") Some types of arthritis may cause joint deformity. This may be a sign of severe, untreated rheumatoid arthritis or of osteoarthritis. Blood tests and joint x-rays are often done to check for infection and other causes of arthritis. The provider may also remove a sample of joint fluid with a needle and send it to a lab to be checked for inflammation crystals or infection. Treatment The underlying cause often cannot be cured. The goal of treatment is to: Reduce pain and inflammation Improve function Prevent further joint damage LIFESTYLE CHANGES Lifestyle changes are the preferred treatment for osteoarthritis and other types of joint swelling. Exercise can help relieve stiffness, reduce pain and fatigue, and improve muscle and bone strength. Your health care team can help you design an exercise program that is best for you. Exercise programs may include: Low-impact aerobic activity (also called endurance exercise) such as walking Range of motion exercises for flexibility Strength training for muscle tone Your provider may suggest physical therapy. This might include: Heat or ice. Splints or orthotics to support joints and help improve their position. This is often needed for rheumatoid arthritis. Water therapy. Massage. Other things you can do include: Get plenty of sleep. Sleeping 8 to 10 hours a night and taking naps during the day can help you recover from a flare-up more quickly, and may even help prevent flare-ups. Avoid staying in one position for too long. Avoid positions or movements that place extra stress on your sore joints. Change your home to make activities easier. For example, install grab bars in the shower, the tub, and near the toilet. Try stress-reducing activities, such as meditation, yoga, or tai chi. Eat a healthy diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables, which contain important vitamins and minerals. Eat foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as cold-water fish (salmon, mackerel, and herring), flaxseed, rapeseed (canola) oil, soybeans, soybean oil, pumpkin seeds, and walnuts. Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. Apply capsaicin cream over your painful joints. You may feel improvement after applying the cream for 3 to 7 days. Lose weight, if you are overweight. Weight loss can greatly improve joint pain in the legs and feet. Use a cane to reduce pain from hip, knee, ankle, or foot arthritis. MEDICINES Medicines may be prescribed along with lifestyle changes. All medicines have some risks. You should be closely followed by a provider when taking arthritis medicines , even ones you buy over-the-counter. Over-the-counter medicines: Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is often the first medicine tried to reduce pain. Take up to 3,000 mg a day (2 extra-strength Tylenol every 8 hours). To prevent damage to your liver, do not take more than the recommended dose. Since multiple medicines are available without a prescription that also contain acetaminophen, you will need to include them in the 3,000 mg per day maximum. Also, avoid alcohol when taking acetaminophen. Aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that can relieve arthritis pain. However, they can carry risks when used for a long time. Possible side effects include heart attack, stroke, stomach ulcers, bleeding from the digestive tract, and kidney damage. Depending on the type of arthritis, a number of other medicines may be prescribed: Corticosteroids ("steroids") help reduce inflammation. They may be injected into painful joints or given by mouth. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are used to treat autoimmune arthritis and SLE Biologics and kinase inhibitors are used for the treatment of autoimmune arthritis. They may be given by injection or by mouth. For gout, certain medicines to lower uric acid levels may be used. It is very important to take your medicines as directed by your provider. If you are having problems doing so (for example, because of side effects), you should talk to your provider. Also make sure your provider knows about all the medicines you are taking, including vitamins and supplements bought without a prescription. SURGERY AND OTHER TREATMENTS In some cases, surgery may be done if other treatments have not worked and severe damage to a joint occurs. This may include: Joint replacement, such as a total knee joint replacement Outlook (Prognosis) A few arthritis-related disorders can be completely cured with proper treatment. Yet, many of these disorders become long-term (chronic) health problems but can often be well-controlled. Aggressive forms of some arthritic conditions may have significant effects on mobility and may lead to involvement of other body organs or systems. Possible Complications Complications of arthritis include: Long-term (chronic) pain Disability Difficulty performing daily activities When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if: Your joint pain persists beyond 3 days. You have severe unexplained joint pain. The affected joint is significantly swollen. You have a hard time moving the joint. Your skin around the joint is red or hot to the touch. You have a fever or have lost weight unintentionally. Prevention Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent joint damage. If you have a family history of arthritis, tell your provider, even if you do not have joint pain. Avoiding excessive, repeated motions may help protect you against osteoarthritis.

Atrial fibrillation or flutter is a common type of abnormal heartbeat. The heart rhythm is fast and irregular. You were in the hospital to treat this condition. When You're in the Hospital You may have been in the hospital because you have atrial fibrillation . This condition occurs when your heart beats irregularly and often faster than normal. You may have developed this problem while you were in the hospital for a heart attack , heart surgery, or other serious illness such as pneumonia or injury. Treatments you may have received include: Pacemaker Cardioversion (this is a procedure done to change the beat of your heart back to normal. It can be done with medicine or an electric shock.) Cardiac ablation You may have been given medicines to change your heartbeat or slow it down. Some are: Beta blockers, such as metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol-XL) or atenolol (Senormin, Tenormin) Calcium channel blockers, such as diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac) or verapamil (Calan, Verelan) Digoxin Antiarrhythmics (medicines that control heart rhythm), such as amiodarone (Cordarone, Pacerone), flecainide (Tambocor), or sotalol (Betapace) Taking Your Medicines Have all of your prescriptions filled before you go home. You should take your medicines the way your health care provider has told you to. Tell your provider about other medicines you are taking including over-the-counter medicines, herbs, or supplements. Ask if it is OK to keep taking these. Also, tell your provider if you are taking antacids. Never stop taking any of your medicines without first talking to your provider. Do not skip a dose unless you are told to. Sometimes certain medicines are prescribed to be taken only when you have symptoms. Be sure you understand when to take your medicines. You may be taking aspirin or clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient), ticagrelor (Brilinta), warfarin (Coumadin), heparin, or another blood thinner such as apixiban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), dabigatran (Pradaxa) to help keep your blood from clotting. If you are taking any blood thinner: You need to watch for any bleeding or bruising, and let your provider know if it happens. Tell dentist, pharmacist, and other providers that you are taking this drug. You will need to have extra blood tests to make sure your dose is correct if you are taking warfarin. Lifestyle Limit how much alcohol you drink. Ask your provider when it is OK to drink, and how much is safe. Do not smoke cigarettes. If you do smoke, your provider can help you quit. Follow a heart healthy diet. Avoid salty and fatty foods. Stay away from fast-food restaurants. Your provider can refer you to a dietitian, who can help you plan a healthy diet. If you take warfarin, do not make big changes in your diet or take vitamins without checking with your provider. Try to avoid stressful situations. Tell your provider if you feel stressed or sad. Talking to a counselor may help. Learn how to check your pulse, and check it every day. It is better to take your own pulse than to use a machine. A machine may be less accurate because of atrial fibrillation. Limit the amount of caffeine you drink (found in coffee, tea, colas, and many other beverages.) Do not use cocaine, amphetamines, or any other illegal drugs. They may make your heart beat faster, and cause permanent damage to your heart. Ask your provider for recommendations for physical activity and exercise. When to Call the Doctor Call for emergency help if you feel: Pain, pressure, tightness, or heaviness in your chest, arm, neck, or jaw Shortness of breath Gas pains or indigestion Sweaty, or if you lose color Lightheaded Fast heartbeat, irregular heartbeat, or your heart is pounding uncomfortably Numbness or weakness in your face, arm, or leg Blurry or decreased vision Problems speaking or understanding speech Dizziness, loss of balance, or falling Severe headache Bleeding Alternative Names Auricular fibrillation - discharge; A-fib - discharge; AF - discharge; Afib - discharge References Calkins H, Tomaselli GF, Morady F.

An armpit lump is a swelling or bump under the arm. A lump in the armpit can have many causes. These include swollen lymph nodes, infections, or cysts. Causes Lumps in the armpit may have many causes. Lymph nodes act as filters that can catch germs or cancerous tumor cells. When they do, lymph nodes increase in size and are easily felt. Reasons lymph nodes in the armpit area may be enlarged are: Arm or breast infection Some body-wide infections, such as mono, AIDS, or herpes Cancers , such as lymphomas or breast cancer Cysts or abscesses under the skin may also produce large, painful lumps in the armpit. These may be caused by shaving or use of antiperspirants (not deodorants). This is most often seen in teens just beginning to shave. Other causes of armpit lumps may include: Cat scratch disease Lipomas (harmless fatty growths) Use of certain medicines or vaccinations Home Care Home care depends on the reason for the lump. Check with your health care provider to determine the cause. When to Contact a Medical Professional An armpit lump in a woman may be a sign of breast cancer, and it should be checked by a provider right away. Contact your provider if you have an unexplained armpit lump. Do not try to diagnose lumps by yourself. What to Expect at Your Office Visit Your provider will examine you and gently press on the nodes. You will be asked questions about your medical history and symptoms, such as: When did you first notice the lump? Has the lump changed? Are you breastfeeding? Is there anything that makes the lump worse? Is the lump painful? Do you have any other symptoms? You may need more tests, depending on the results of your physical exam.

The kidneys filter the blood and help remove wastes and extra fluid from the body. The kidneys also help control the body's chemical balance. The kidneys are part of the urinary system, which also includes the ureters, bladder, and urethra. Muscle changes and changes in the reproductive system can affect bladder control. AGING CHANGES AND THEIR EFFECTS ON THE KIDNEYS AND BLADDER As you age, your kidneys and bladder change. This can affect their function. Changes in the kidneys that occur with age: Amount of kidney tissue decreases and kidney function diminishes. Number of filtering units (nephrons) decreases. Nephrons filter waste material from the blood. Blood vessels supplying the kidneys can become hardened. This causes the kidneys to filter blood more slowly. Changes in the bladder: The bladder wall changes. The elastic tissue becomes stiffer and the bladder becomes less stretchy. The bladder cannot hold as much urine as before. The bladder muscles weaken. The urethra can become partially or totally blocked. In women, this can be due to weakened muscles that cause the bladder or vagina to fall out of position (prolapse). In men, the urethra can become blocked by an enlarged prostate gland . In a healthy aging person, kidney function declines very slowly. Illness, medicines, and other conditions can significantly degrade kidney function. COMMON PROBLEMS Aging increases the risk of kidney and bladder problems such as: Bladder control issues, such as leakage or urinary incontinence (not being able to hold your urine), or urinary retention (not being able to completely empty your bladder) Bladder and other urinary tract infections (UTIs) Chronic kidney disease WHEN TO CONTACT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL Contact your health care provider right away if you have any of the following: Signs of a urinary tract infection, including fever or chills, burning when urinating, nausea and vomiting, extreme tiredness, or flank pain Very dark urine or fresh blood in the urine Trouble urinating Urinating more often than usual (polyuria) Sudden need to urinate ( urinary urgency ) As you grow older, you will have other changes, including: In the bones, muscles, and joints In the male reproductive system In the female reproductive system In organs, tissues, and cells Images Changes in kidney with age References Griebling TL.

Poisoning may also occur if you swallow or touch products that contain very large amounts of ammonia. WARNING: Never mix ammonia with bleach. This causes the release of toxic chlorine gas, which can be deadly. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. Poisonous Ingredient The poisonous ingredient is: Ammonia Where Found Ammonia can be found in: Ammonia gas Some household cleaners Some liniments Some fertilizers Note: This list may not be all-inclusive. Symptoms Symptoms can affect many parts of the body. AIRWAYS, LUNGS, AND CHEST Cough Chest pain (severe) Chest tightness Difficulty breathing Rapid breathing Wheezing BODY-WIDE SYMPTOMS Fever EYES, EARS, NOSE, MOUTH, AND THROAT Tearing and burning of eyes Temporary blindness Throat pain (severe) Mouth pain Lip swelling HEART AND BLOOD Rapid, weak pulse Collapse and shock NERVOUS SYSTEM Confusion Difficulty walking Dizziness Lack of coordination Restlessness Stupor (altered level of consciousness) SKIN Bluish-colored lips and fingernails Severe burns if contact is longer than a few minutes STOMACH AND GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT Severe stomach pain Vomiting Home Care DO NOT make a person throw up unless told to do so by poison control or a health care professional. Seek immediate medical help. If the chemical is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes. If the chemical was swallowed, immediately give the person water or milk, unless told otherwise by a health care provider. DO NOT give water or milk if the person is having symptoms (such as vomiting, convulsions, or a decreased level of alertness) that make it hard to swallow. If the poison was inhaled, immediately move them to fresh air. Before Calling Emergency Determine the following information: Person's age, weight, and condition Name of product (as well as the ingredients and strengths, if known) Time it was swallowed Amount swallowed Poison Control Your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. What to Expect at the Emergency Room The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Blood and urine tests will be done. The person may receive: Airway and breathing support, including oxygen. In extreme cases, a tube may be passed through the mouth into the lungs to prevent aspiration. A breathing machine (ventilator) would then be needed. Bronchoscopy, which involves inserting a camera into the throat, bronchial tubes, and lungs to check for burns in those tissues. Chest x-ray . ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing). Endoscopy - a camera down the throat to see burns in the esophagus and stomach. Fluids through a vein (by IV). Medicines to treat symptoms. Outlook (Prognosis) Damage is related to the amount and strength (concentration) of the ammonia. Most household cleaners are relatively weak and cause little or mild damage. Industrial strength cleaners can cause severe burns and injury. Survival past 48 hours most often indicates recovery will occur. Chemical burns that occurred in the eye frequently heal; however, permanent blindness may result. References Levine MD. Chemical injuries. In: Walls RM, ed.

The ammonia test measures the level of ammonia in a blood sample. How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed. How to Prepare for the Test Your health care provider may ask you to stop taking certain drugs that may affect test results. These include: Alcohol Acetazolamide Barbiturates Diuretics Narcotics Valproic acid You should not smoke before your blood is drawn. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed Ammonia (NH 3 ) is produced by cells throughout the body, especially the intestines, liver, and kidneys. Most of the ammonia produced in the body is used by the liver to produce urea. Urea is also a waste product, but it is much less toxic than ammonia. Ammonia is especially toxic to the brain. It can cause confusion, low energy, and sometimes coma. This test may be done if you have, or your provider thinks you have, a condition that may cause a toxic buildup of ammonia. It is most commonly used to diagnose and monitor hepatic encephalopathy , a severe liver disease. Normal Results The normal range is 15 to 45 µ/dL (11 to 32 µmol/L). Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean Abnormal results may mean you have increased ammonia levels in your blood. This may be due to any of the following: Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding , usually in the upper GI tract Genetic diseases of the urea cycle High body temperature (hyperthermia) Kidney disease Liver failure Low blood potassium level (in people with liver disease) Parenteral nutrition (nutrition by vein) Reye syndrome Salicylate poisoning Severe muscle exertion Ureterosigmoidostomy (a procedure to reconstruct the urinary tract in certain illnesses) Urinary tract infection with a bacteria called Proteus mirabilis A high-protein diet can also raise the blood ammonia level. Risks There is little risk in having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Multiple punctures to locate veins Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names Serum ammonia; Encephalopathy - ammonia; Cirrhosis - ammonia; Liver failure - ammonia Images Blood test References Daniels L, Khalili M, Goldstein E, Bluth MH, Bowne WB, Pincus MR.

The lungs have two main functions. One is to get oxygen from the air into the body. The other is to remove carbon dioxide from the body. Your body needs oxygen to work properly. Carbon dioxide is a gas your body produces when it uses oxygen. Watch this video about: Breathing During breathing, air enters and exits the lungs. When you breathe in (inhale), air flows through the airways into the lungs. The airways are made of stretchy tissue. Bands of muscle and other support tissue wrap around each airway to help keep them open. Air keeps flowing into the lungs until it fills tiny air sacs called alveoli. Blood circulates around these air sacs through tiny blood vessels called capillaries. Oxygen crosses into the bloodstream at the place where the blood vessels and air sacs meet. This is also where carbon dioxide crosses from the bloodstream into the lungs to be breathed out (exhaled). Watch this video about: Gas exchange AGING CHANGES IN YOUR BODY AND THEIR EFFECTS ON THE LUNGS Changes to the bones and muscles of the chest and spine: Bones become thinner and change shape. This can change the shape of your ribcage. As a result, your ribcage may not expand and contract as well during breathing. The muscle that supports your breathing, the diaphragm, becomes weakened. This weakness may prevent you from breathing enough air in or out. These changes in your bones and muscles may lower the oxygen level in your body. Also, less carbon dioxide may be removed from your body. Symptoms such as tiredness and shortness of breath can result. Changes to lung tissue: Muscles and other tissues that are near your airways may lose their ability to keep the airways completely open. This causes the airways to close easily. Aging also causes the air sacs to lose their shape and become baggy. These changes in lung tissue can allow air to get trapped in your lungs. Too little oxygen may enter your blood vessels and less carbon dioxide may be removed. This makes it hard to breathe. Changes to the nervous system: The part of the brain that controls breathing may lose some of its function. When this happens, your lungs are not able to get enough oxygen. Not enough carbon dioxide may leave the lungs. Breathing may get more difficult. Nerves in your airways that trigger coughing become less sensitive. Large amounts of particles like smoke or germs may collect in the lungs and may be hard to cough up. Changes to the immune system: Your immune system can get weaker. This means your body is less able to fight lung infections and other diseases. Your lungs are also less able to recover after exposure to smoke or other harmful particles. COMMON PROBLEMS As a result of these changes, older people are at increased risk for: Lung infections, such as pneumonia and bronchitis Shortness of breath Low oxygen level Abnormal breathing patterns, resulting in problems such as sleep apnea (episodes of stopped breathing during sleep) PREVENTION To decrease the effects of aging on the lungs: Do not smoke. Avoid exposure to cigarette smoke. Smoking and smoke exposure harm the lungs and speeds up lung aging. Do physical exercise to improve lung function. Get up and move. Lying in bed or sitting for long periods allows mucus to collect in the lungs. This puts you at risk of lung infections. This is especially true right after surgery or when you are ill. OTHER CHANGES RELATED TO AGING As you grow older, you will have other changes, including: In organs, tissues, and cells In the bones, muscles, and joints In the heart and blood vessels In vital signs Images Respiratory cilia Changes in lung tissue with age References Davies GA, Bolton CE.

Your Achilles tendon joins your calf muscle to your heel. You can tear your Achilles tendon if you land hard on your heel during sports, from a jump, accelerating when you are pushing off, or when stepping into a hole. Surgery to repair the Achilles tendon is done if your Achilles tendon has a complete tear. Description To fix your torn Achilles tendon, the surgeon will: Make a cut down the back of your heel Make several small cuts rather than one large cut After that, the surgeon will: Bring the ends of your tendon together Sew the ends together Stitch the wound closed Why the Procedure is Performed Before surgery is considered, you and your health care provider will talk about ways to take care of your Achilles tendon rupture . You may need this surgery if your Achilles tendon has torn and separated. You need your Achilles tendon to point your toes and push off your foot when walking. If your Achilles tendon is not fixed, you can have problems walking up stairs or rising up on your toes. However, studies have shown that Achilles tendon tears can be treated without surgery and have similar outcomes. Talk to your provider about which course of treatment is best for you. Risks Risks from anesthesia and surgery are: Breathing problems Reactions to medicines Bleeding or infection Possible problems from Achilles tendon repair are: Damage to nerves in the foot Foot swelling Problems with blood flow to the foot Wound healing problems, which may require more surgeries Scaring of the Achilles tendon Blood clot or deep vein thrombosis Some loss of calf muscle strength There is a small chance that your Achilles tendon could tear again. About 5 out of 100 people will have their Achilles tendon tear again. Before the Procedure Always tell your surgeon: If you could be pregnant What medicines you are taking, including medicines, herbs, or supplements you bought without a prescription If you have been drinking a lot of alcohol During the days before the surgery: You may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other medicines that make it hard for your blood to clot. Ask your provider which medicines you should still take on the day of the surgery. If you smoke, ask your provider for help quitting. You should elevate your ankle to decrease swelling. On the day of the surgery: You will probably be asked not to drink or eat anything for several hours before the surgery. Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water. Your surgeon will tell you when to arrive. After the Procedure Work with your surgeon to keep your pain in control. Your heel may be very sore. You will be wearing a cast or splint for a period of time. Many people can be discharged the same day of the surgery. Some people may require a short stay in the hospital. Keep your leg elevated for as much as possible during the first 2 weeks to reduce swelling and promote wound healing. Outlook (Prognosis) You will be able to resume full activity in about 6 months. Expect full recovery to take about 9 months. Alternative Names Achilles tendon rupture - surgery; Percutaneous Achilles tendon rupture repair References Azar FM. Traumatic disorders.

Aplastic anemia is a condition in which the bone marrow does not make enough blood cells. Bone marrow is the soft, tissue in the center of bones that is responsible for producing blood cells and platelets. Causes Aplastic anemia results from damage to the blood stem cells. Stem cells are immature cells in the bone marrow that give rise to all blood cell types (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets). Injury to the stem cells leads to a decrease in the number of these blood cell types. Aplastic anemia can be caused by: Use of certain medicines or exposure to toxic chemicals (such as chloramphenicol, benzene) Exposure to radiation or chemotherapy Autoimmune disorders Pregnancy Viruses Sometimes, the cause is unknown. In this case, the disorder is called idiopathic aplastic anemia. Symptoms Symptoms are due to the underproduction of red cells, white cells, and platelets. Symptoms may be severe from the start or gradually worsen over time as the disease progresses. Low red cell count (anemia) can cause: Fatigue Pallor (paleness) Rapid heart rate Shortness of breath with exercise Weakness Lightheadedness upon standing Low white cell count (leukopenia) causes an increased risk for infection. Low platelet count ( thrombocytopenia ) can result in bleeding. Symptoms include: Bleeding gums Easy bruising Nose bleeds Rash, small pinpoint red marks on the skin (petechiae) Frequent or severe infections (less common) Exams and Tests Blood tests will show: Low red blood cell count (anemia) Low white blood cell count (leukopenia) Low reticulocyte count (reticulocytes are the youngest red blood cells) Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) A bone marrow biopsy shows fewer-than-normal blood cells and an increased amount of fat. Treatment Mild cases of aplastic anemia that do not have symptoms may not require treatment. As blood cell counts become lower and symptoms develop, blood and platelets may be given through transfusions. Over time, transfusions may stop working, resulting in very low blood cell counts. This is a life-threatening condition. Bone marrow , or stem cell transplant may be recommended for younger people. It is more likely to be recommended for those 50 years and younger, but people over 50 may receive a transplant if they are healthy enough. This treatment works best when the donor is a fully-matched brother or sister. This is called a matched sibling donor.. Older people and those who do not have a matched sibling donor are given medicine to suppress the immune system. These medicines may allow the bone marrow to once again make healthy blood cells. But the disease may return (relapse). A bone marrow transplant with an unrelated donor may be tried if these medicines do not help or if the disease comes back after getting better. Outlook (Prognosis) Untreated, severe aplastic anemia leads to rapid death. Bone marrow transplant can be very successful in young people. A transplant is also used in older people or when the disease comes back after medicines have stopped working. Possible Complications Complications may include: Severe infections or bleeding Complications of bone marrow transplant Reactions to medicines Hemochromatosis (buildup of too much iron in the body tissues from many red cell transfusions) When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your health care provider or go to the emergency room if bleeding occurs for no reason, or if bleeding is hard to stop. Contact your provider if you notice frequent infections or unusual fatigue.

Actinomycosis is a long-term ( chronic ) bacterial infection that commonly affects the face and neck. Causes Actinomycosis is usually caused by the bacterium called Actinomyces israelii . This is a common organism found in the nose and throat. It normally does not cause disease. Because of the bacteria's normal location in the nose and throat, actinomycosis most commonly affects the face and neck. The infection can sometimes occur in the chest ( pulmonary actinomycosis ), abdomen, pelvis, or other areas of the body. The infection is not contagious. This means it does not spread to other people. Symptoms occur when the bacteria enter the tissues of the face after trauma, surgery, or infection. Common triggers include dental abscess or oral surgery. The infection can also affect certain women who have had an intrauterine device (IUD) to prevent pregnancy. Once in the tissue, the bacteria cause an abscess, producing a hard, red to reddish-purple lump, often on the jaw, from which comes the condition's common name, "lumpy jaw." Eventually, the abscess breaks through the skin surface to produce a draining sinus tract. Symptoms Symptoms may include any of the following: Draining sores in the skin, especially on the chest wall from lung infection with Actinomyces Fever Mild or no pain Swelling or a hard, red to reddish-purple lump on the face or upper neck Weight loss Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. Tests that may be done to check for presence of the bacteria include: Culture of the tissue or fluid Examination of drained fluid under a microscope CT scan of affected areas Treatment Treatment of actinomycosis usually requires antibiotics for several months to a year. Surgical drainage or removal of the affected area (lesion) may be needed. If the condition is related to an IUD, the device must be removed. Outlook (Prognosis) Full recovery can be expected with treatment. Possible Complications In rare cases, meningitis can develop from actinomycosis. Meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. This membrane is called the meninges. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you develop symptoms of this infection. Starting treatment right away helps quicken the recovery.

Pneumonia is inflammation (swelling) and infection of the lungs or large airways. Aspiration pneumonia occurs when food or liquid is breathed into the airways or lungs, instead of being swallowed. Causes Risk factors for breathing in ( aspiration ) of foreign material into the lungs are: Being less alert due to medicines, illness, surgery, or other reasons Coma Drinking large amounts of alcohol Taking illicit drugs (such as opioids) which make you less alert Receiving medicine to put you into a deep sleep for surgery ( general anesthesia ) Old age Poor gag reflex in people who are not alert (unconscious or semi-conscious) after a stroke or brain injury Problems with swallowing Eating or being fed when not upright Being hospitalized can increase the risk for this condition. Materials that may be breathed into the lungs include: Saliva Vomit Liquids Foods The type of bacteria that causes the pneumonia depends on: Your health Where you live (at home or in a long-term nursing facility, for example) Whether you were recently hospitalized Your recent antibiotic use Whether your immune system is weakened Symptoms Symptoms may include any of the following: Chest pain Coughing up foul-smelling, greenish or dark phlegm (sputum), or phlegm that contains pus or blood Fatigue Fever Shortness of breath Wheezing Breath odor Excessive sweating Problems swallowing Confusion Seeing food or tube feed material (if being fed artificially) in your sputum Exams and Tests Your health care provider will use a stethoscope to listen for crackles or abnormal breath sounds in your chest. Tapping on your chest wall (percussion) helps the provider listen and feel for abnormal sounds in your chest. If pneumonia is suspected, your provider will likely order a chest x-ray . The following tests also may help diagnose this condition: Arterial blood gas Blood culture Bronchoscopy (uses a special scope to view the lung airways) in some cases Complete blood count ( CBC ) X-rays or CT scan of the chest Sputum culture Swallowing tests Treatment Some people may need to be hospitalized. Treatment depends on how severe the pneumonia is and how ill the person is before the aspiration (chronic illness). Sometimes a ventilator (breathing machine) is needed to support breathing. You will likely receive antibiotics. You may need to have your swallowing function tested. People who have trouble swallowing may need to use other feeding methods to reduce the risk of aspiration. Outlook (Prognosis) Outcome depends on: The health of the person before getting pneumonia The type of bacteria causing the pneumonia How much of the lungs are involved More severe infections may result in long-term damage to the lungs. Possible Complications Complications may include: Lung abscess Shock Spread of infection to the bloodstream ( bacteremia ) Spread of infection to other areas of the body Respiratory failure Death When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider, go to the emergency room, or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have: Chest pain Chills Fever Shortness of breath Bluish discoloration of the lips or tongue (cyanosis) Wheezing Alternative Names Anaerobic pneumonia; Aspiration of vomitus; Necrotizing pneumonia; Aspiration pneumonitis Patient Instructions Pneumonia in adults - discharge Images Pneumococci organism Bronchoscopy Lungs Respiratory system References Baden LR, Griffin MR, Klompas M.

Aspergillosis precipitin is a laboratory test to detect antibodies in the blood resulting from exposure to the fungus aspergillus . How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed . The sample is sent to a laboratory where it is examined for precipitin bands that form when aspergillus antibodies are present. How to Prepare for the Test There is no special preparation. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed Your health care provider may order this test if you have signs of an aspergillosis infection. Normal Results A normal test result means you do not have aspergillus antibodies. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean A positive result means antibodies to the fungus have been detected. This result means you have been exposed to the fungus at some point, but it does not necessarily mean you have an active infection. False-negative results are possible. For example, invasive aspergillosis often does not produce a positive result, even though aspergillus is present. Risks There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Multiple punctures to locate veins Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names Aspergillus immunodiffusion test; Test for precipitating antibodies Images Blood test References Iwen PC, Thompson GR, Wiederhold NP.

              secure websites.ere: Home → Medical Encyclopedia → Ankle pain URL of this page: //medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003167.htm Ankle pain To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript. Ankle pain involves any discomfort in one or both ankles. Causes Ankle pain is often due to an ankle sprain. An ankle sprain is an injury to the ligaments, which connect bones to one another. In most cases, the ankle is twisted inward, causing small tears in the ligaments. The tearing leads to swelling and bruising, making it difficult to bear weight on the joint. The ligament injuries are more common on the outside of your ankle but the inside ligaments can tear also. In addition to ankle sprains, ankle pain can be caused by: Damage or swelling of tendons (which join muscles to bone) or cartilage (which cushions joints) Infection in the ankle joint Osteoarthritis , gout , rheumatoid arthritis , Reiter syndrome , and other types of arthritis Problems in areas near the ankle that can cause you to feel pain in the ankle include: Blockage of blood vessels in the leg Heel pain or injuries Tendinitis around the ankle joint Nerve injuries (such as tarsal tunnel syndrome or sciatica ) Home Care Home care for ankle pain depends on the cause and what other treatment or surgery has taken place. You may be asked to: Rest your ankle for several days. Try to NOT put much weight on your ankle. Put on an ACE bandage. You also can buy a brace that supports your ankle. Use crutches or a cane to help take the weight off a sore or unsteady ankle. Keep your foot raised above the level of your heart. When you are sitting or sleeping, place two pillows under your ankle. Ice the area right away. Apply ice for 10 to 15 minutes every hour for the first day. Then, apply ice every 3 to 4 hours for 2 more days. Try acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or other pain relievers made by the store. You may need a brace to support the ankle or a boot to rest your ankle. As the swelling and pain improve, you may still need to keep extra weight and stress off your ankle for a period of time. The injury may take a few weeks to many months to fully heal. Once the pain and swelling are mostly gone, the injured ankle will still be a little weaker and less stable than the uninjured ankle. You will need to start exercises to strengthen your ankle and avoid injury in the future. DO NOT begin these exercises until a health care professional tells you it is safe to start. You will also need to work on your balance and agility to avoid another injury or sprain. Other advice your health care provider may give you include: Avoid putting on extra weight since this could increase strain on your ankles. Warm up before exercising. Stretch the muscles and tendons that support the ankle. Avoid sports and activities for which you are not properly conditioned. Make sure that shoes fit you properly. Avoid high-heeled shoes. If you are prone to ankle pain or twisting your ankle during certain activities, use ankle support braces. These include air casts, ACE bandages, or lace-up ankle supports. Work on your balance and do agility exercises. When to Contact a Medical Professional Go to the hospital if: You have severe pain even when you are NOT bearing weight. You suspect a broken bone (the joint looks deformed or you cannot put any weight on the leg). You can hear a popping sound and have immediate pain in the joint. You can't move your ankle back and forth. Contact your provider if: Swelling does not go down within 2 to 3 days. You have symptoms of infection. The area becomes red, more painful, or warm, or you have a fever over 100°F (37.7°C). The pain does not go away after several weeks. Other joints are also involved. You have a history of arthritis and are having new symptoms. Alternative Names Pain - ankle Images Ankle sprain swelling Ankle sprain Sprained ankle References Chiodo CP, Price MD, Sangeorzan AP.

Alopecia areata is a condition that causes round patches of hair loss. It can lead to total hair loss. Causes Alopecia areata is thought to be an autoimmune condition . This occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy hair follicles. Some people with this condition have a family history of alopecia . Alopecia areata is seen in men, women, and children. In a few people, hair loss may occur after a major life event such as an illness, pregnancy, or trauma. Symptoms Hair loss is usually the only symptom. A few people may also feel a burning sensation or itching. Alopecia areata usually begins as one to several (1 cm to 4 cm) patches of hair loss. Hair loss is most often seen on the scalp. It may also occur in the beard, eyebrows, pubic hair, and arms or legs in some people. Nail pitting may also occur. Patches where hair has fallen out are smooth and round in shape. They may be peach-colored. Hairs that look like exclamation points are sometimes seen at the edges of a bald patch with a magnifying tool. If alopecia areata leads to total hair loss, it often occurs within 6 months after symptoms first start. This is called alopecia totalis when the entire scalp is involved, and alopecia universalis when the entire body is affected. Exams and Tests The health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms, focusing on areas where you have hair loss. A scalp biopsy may be done. Blood tests may also be done to check for autoimmune conditions and thyroid problems. Treatment If hair loss is not widespread, the hair will often regrow in a few months without treatment. For more severe hair loss, it is not clear how much treatment can help change the course of the condition. Common treatments may include: Steroid injection under the skin surface Medicines applied to the skin Ultraviolet light therapy A wig may be used to hide areas of hair loss. Support Groups More information and support for people with alopecia areata and their families can be found at: National Alopecia Areata Foundation -- www.naaf.org Outlook (Prognosis) Full recovery of hair is common.

Amelogenesis imperfecta is a tooth development disorder. It causes the tooth enamel to be thin and abnormally formed. Enamel is the outer layer of the coronal, or crown portion of the teeth. Causes Amelogenesis imperfecta is passed down through families as a dominant trait . That means you only need to get the abnormal gene from one parent in order to get the disease. Symptoms The enamel of the tooth is soft and thin. The teeth appear yellow and are easily damaged. Both baby teeth and permanent teeth can be affected. Exams and Tests A dentist can identify and diagnose this condition. Treatment The treatment depends on how severe the problem is. Full crowns may be necessary to improve the appearance of the teeth and protect them from further damage. Eating a diet that is low in sugar and practicing very good oral hygiene can reduce the chance of developing cavities. Outlook (Prognosis) Treatment is often successful in protecting the teeth. Possible Complications The enamel is easily damaged, which affects the appearance of the teeth, especially if left untreated. When to Contact a Medical Professional Call your dentist if you have symptoms of this condition. Alternative Names AI; Congenital enamel hypoplasia References Dhar V.

Analgesic nephropathy involves damage to one or both kidneys caused by overexposure to mixtures of medicines, especially over-the-counter pain medicines (analgesics). Causes Analgesic nephropathy involves damage within the internal structures of the kidney. It is caused by long-term use of analgesics (pain medicines), especially over-the-counter (OTC) medicines that contain phenacetin or acetaminophen, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen. This condition frequently occurs as a result of self-medicating, often for some type of chronic pain such as headache or arthritis. Risk factors include: Use of OTC analgesics containing more than one active ingredient Taking 6 or more pills a day for 3 years Chronic headaches, painful menstrual periods, backache, or musculoskeletal pain Emotional or behavioral changes History of dependent behaviors including smoking, alcohol use, and excessive use of tranquilizers Symptoms There may be no symptoms in the beginning. Over time, as the kidneys are injured by the medicine, symptoms of kidney disease will develop, including: Fatigue, weakness Increased urinary frequency or urgency Blood in the urine Flank pain or back pain Decreased urine output Decreased alertness , including drowsiness, confusion, and lethargy Decreased sensation, numbness (especially in the legs) Nausea, vomiting Easy bruising or bleeding Swelling (edema) throughout the body Exams and Tests Your health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms. During the exam, your provider may find: Your blood pressure is high. When listening with a stethoscope, your heart and lungs have abnormal sounds. You have swelling, especially in the lower legs. Your skin shows premature aging. Tests that may be done include: Complete blood count CT scan of kidney Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) Toxicology screen Urinalysis Kidney ultrasound Treatment The primary goals of treatment are to prevent further damage of the kidneys and to treat kidney failure. Your provider may tell you to stop taking all suspect painkillers, particularly OTC medicines. To treat kidney failure, your provider may suggest diet changes and fluid restriction. Eventually, dialysis or a kidney transplant may be needed. Counseling may help you develop alternative methods of controlling chronic pain. Outlook (Prognosis) The damage to the kidney may be acute and temporary, or chronic and long term. Possible Complications Complications that may result from analgesic nephropathy include: Acute kidney failure Chronic kidney failure Kidney disorder in which the spaces between the kidney tubules become inflamed
   ( interstitial nephritis ) Tissue death in areas where the openings of the collecting ducts enter the kidney and where urine flows into the ureters
   ( renal papillary necrosis ) Urinary tract infections that are ongoing or keep coming back High blood pressure Cancer of the kidney or ureter When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have any of the following: Symptoms of analgesic nephropathy, especially if you have been using painkillers for a long time Blood or solid material in your urine Amount of your urine has decreased Prevention Follow your provider's instructions when using medicines, including OTCs. Do not take more than the recommended dose without asking your provider.

Autosomal recessive is one of several ways that a genetic trait, disorder, or disease can be passed down through families. An autosomal recessive disorder means two copies of an abnormal gene must be present in order for the disease or trait to develop. Information Inheriting a specific disease, condition, or trait depends on the type of chromosome that is affected. The two types are autosomal chromosomes and sex chromosomes. It also depends on whether the trait is dominant or recessive. A variation in a gene on one of the first 22 nonsex chromosomes can lead to an autosomal disorder. Genes come in pairs. One gene in each pair comes from the egg, and the other gene comes from the sperm. Recessive inheritance means both genes in a pair must be abnormal to cause disease. People with only one variant gene in the pair are called carriers. These people are most often not affected with the condition. However, they can pass the variant gene to their children. CHANCES OF INHERITING A TRAIT If you are born to parents who both carry the same autosomal recessive gene, you have a 25% (1 in 4) chance of inheriting the variant gene from both parents and developing the disease. You have a 50% (1 in 2) chance of inheriting one variant gene. This would make you a carrier. In other words, for a child born to a couple who both carry the variant gene (but do not have signs of disease), the expected outcome for each pregnancy is: A 25% chance that the child is born with two normal genes (healthy) A 50% chance that the child is born with one normal and one variant gene (carrier, without disease) A 25% chance that the child is born with two variant genes (at risk for the disease) Note: These outcomes do not mean that the children will definitely be carriers or be severely affected.

Ascites is the build-up of fluid in the space between the lining of the abdomen and abdominal organs. Causes Ascites results from high pressure in certain veins of the liver (portal hypertension) and low blood levels of a protein called albumin . Diseases that can cause severe liver damage can lead to ascites. These include: Chronic hepatitis C or B infection Alcohol overuse over many years Fatty liver disease (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH) Cirrhosis caused by genetic diseases People with certain cancers in the abdomen may develop ascites. These include cancer of the appendix, colon, ovaries, uterus, pancreas, and liver. Other conditions that can cause this problem include: Clots in the veins of the liver (portal vein thrombosis) Congestive heart failure Pancreatitis Thickening and scarring of the sac-like covering of the heart (pericarditis) Kidney dialysis may also be linked to ascites. Symptoms Symptoms may develop slowly or suddenly depending on the cause of ascites. You may have no symptoms if there is only a small amount of fluid in the belly. As more fluid collects, you may have abdominal pain and bloating. Large amounts of fluid can cause shortness of breath. This happens because the fluid pushes up on the diaphragm, which in turn compresses the lower lungs. Many other symptoms of liver failure may also be present. Exams and Tests Your doctor will do a physical exam to determine if the swelling is likely due to fluid buildup in your belly. You may also have the following tests to assess your liver and kidneys: 24-hour urine collection Electrolyte levels Kidney function tests Liver function tests Tests to measure the risk of bleeding and protein levels in the blood Urinalysis Abdominal ultrasound CT scan of the abdomen Your doctor may also use a thin needle to withdraw ascites fluid from your belly. The fluid is tested to look for the cause of ascites and to check if the fluid is infected. Treatment The condition that causes ascites will be treated, if possible. Treatments for fluid build-up may include lifestyle changes : Avoiding alcohol Lowering salt in your diet (no more than 1,500 mg/day of sodium) Limiting fluid intake You may also get medicines from your doctor, including: "Water pills" (diuretics) to get rid of extra fluid Antibiotics for infections Other things you can do to help take care of your liver disease are: Get vaccinated for diseases such as influenza, hepatitis A and hepatitis B, and pneumococcal infection Talk to your doctor about all medicines you take, including herbs and supplements and over-the-counter medicines Procedures that you may have are: Inserting a needle into the belly to remove large volumes of fluid (called a paracentesis) Placing a special tube or shunt inside your liver (TIPS) to repair blood flow to the liver People with end-stage liver disease may need a liver transplant . If you have cirrhosis, avoid taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). Acetaminophen should be taken in reduced doses. Possible Complications Complications may include: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (a life-threatening infection of the ascitic fluid) Hepatorenal syndrome (kidney failure) Weight loss and protein malnutrition Mental confusion, change in the level of alertness, or coma (hepatic encephalopathy) Bleeding from the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract Build-up of fluid in the space between your lungs and chest cavity (pleural effusion) Other complications of liver cirrhosis When to Contact a Medical Professional If you have ascites, contact your health care provider right away if you have: Fever above 100.5°F (38.05°C), or a fever that does not go away Belly pain Blood in your stool or black, tarry stools Blood in your vomit Bruising or bleeding that occurs easily Build-up of fluid in your belly Swollen legs or ankles Breathing problems Confusion or problems staying awake Yellow color in your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice) Alternative Names Portal hypertension - ascites; Cirrhosis - ascites; Liver failure - ascites; Alcohol use - ascites; End-stage liver disease - ascites; ESLD - ascites; Pancreatitis ascites Images Ascites with ovarian cancer - CT scan Digestive system organs References Garcia-Tsao G.

Using antibiotics incorrectly can cause some bacteria to change or permit resistant bacteria to grow. These changes make bacteria stronger, so most or all antibiotic medicines no longer work to kill them. This is called antibiotic resistance. Resistant bacteria continue to grow and multiply, making infections harder to treat. Information Antibiotics work by killing bacteria or keeping them from growing. Resistant bacteria keep growing, even when antibiotics are used. This problem is seen most often in hospitals and nursing homes. New antibiotics are created to work against some resistant bacteria. But there are now bacteria that no known antibiotic can kill. Infections with such bacteria are dangerous. Because of this, antibiotic resistance has become a major health concern. Causes of Antibiotic Resistance Antibiotic overuse is a major cause of antibiotic resistance. This occurs in both humans and animals. Certain practices increase the risk of resistant bacteria: Using antibiotics when not needed. Most colds, sore throats, and ear and sinus infections are caused by viruses. Antibiotics don't work against viruses. Many people don't understand this and sometimes ask for antibiotics when they are not helpful or needed. This leads to an overuse of antibiotics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1 in 3 antibiotic prescriptions are not needed. Not taking antibiotics as prescribed. This includes not taking all of your antibiotics, missing doses, or using leftover antibiotics. Doing so helps the bacteria learn how to grow in spite of the antibiotic. As a result, the infection may not fully respond to treatment the next time the antibiotic is used. Misuse of antibiotics. You should never buy antibiotics online without a prescription or take someone else's antibiotics. Exposure to food sources. Antibiotics are widely used in agriculture. This can lead to resistant bacteria in the food supply. Why Antibiotic Resistance Is a Concern Antibiotic resistance causes a number of problems: The need for stronger antibiotics with possibly severe side effects Fewer choices of antibiotics to treat antibiotic-resistant bacteria More expensive treatment Harder-to-treat illness can spread from person to person More hospitalizations and longer hospital stays Serious health problems, and even death How Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Spread Antibiotic resistance can spread from person to person or from animals to humans. In people, it may spread from: One patient to other patients or staff in a nursing home, urgent care center, or hospital Health care staff to other staff or to patients Patients to other people who come in contact with the patient Antibiotic-resistant bacteria may spread from animals to humans through: Food sprayed with water that contains antibiotic-resistant bacteria from animal feces Help Prevent Antibiotic Resistance To prevent antibiotic resistance from spreading: Antibiotics should only be used as directed and when prescribed by your health care provider. Unused antibiotics should be discarded safely . Antibiotics should not be prescribed or used for viral infections.

Adrenal gland removal is an operation in which one or both adrenal glands are removed. The adrenal glands are part of the endocrine system and are located just above the kidneys. Description You will receive general anesthesia that allows you to be asleep and pain free during surgery. Adrenal gland removal can be performed in two ways. The type of surgery you have depends on the problem being treated. With open surgery, the surgeon makes one large surgical cut (incision) to remove the gland. With the laparoscopic technique, several small cuts are made. The surgeon will discuss which approach is better for you. After the adrenal gland is removed, it is sent to a pathologist for examination under a microscope. Why the Procedure is Performed The adrenal gland is removed when there is known cancer or a growth (mass) that might be cancer. Sometimes, a mass in the adrenal gland is removed because it releases a hormone that can cause harmful side effects. One of the most common tumors is a pheochromocytoma , which can cause very high blood pressure Other disorders include Cushing syndrome , Conn syndrome , and an adrenal mass of unknown cause Risks Risks for anesthesia and surgery in general include: Reaction to medicines Breathing problems Bleeding, blood clots, or infection Risks for this surgery include: Damage to nearby organs in the body Wound that breaks open or bulging tissue through the incision (incisional hernia ) Acute adrenal crisis in which there is not enough cortisol, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands Before the Procedure Tell your surgeon or nurse: If you are or could be pregnant What medicines you are taking, even drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription During the days before surgery: You may be asked to temporarily stop taking blood thinners. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), clopidogrel (Plavix), warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), and others. Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of the surgery. If you smoke, try to stop. Smoking slows recovery and increases the risk for problems. Ask your health care provider for help quitting . On the day of surgery: Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking. Take the medicines your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water. Arrive at the hospital on time. After the Procedure While in the hospital, you may: Be asked to sit on the side of the bed and walk on the same day of your surgery Have a tube, or catheter, that comes from your bladder Have a drain that comes out through your surgical cut Not be able to eat the first 1 to 3 days, and then you will begin with liquids Be encouraged to do breathing exercises Wear special stockings to prevent blood clots Receive shots under your skin to prevent blood clots Receive pain medicine Have your blood pressure monitored and continue to receive blood pressure medicine You will be discharged in 1 or 2 days after the surgery. At home: Follow instructions on how to care for yourself as you recover. You can remove the dressing and shower the day after the surgery, unless your surgeon tells you otherwise. You may have some pain and may need to take medicine for pain. You can start doing some light activities. Recovering from open surgery may be painful because of where the surgical cut is located. Recovery after a laparoscopic procedure is most often quicker. Outlook (Prognosis) People who undergo the laparoscopic surgery mostly have faster recovery than with open surgery. How well you do after surgery depends on the reason for the surgery: If you had surgery for Conn syndrome, you may have to stay on blood pressure medicines. If you had surgery for Cushing syndrome, you are at risk for complications that may need to be treated. Your provider can tell you more about this. If you had surgery for pheochromocytoma, the outcome is usually good. Alternative Names Adrenalectomy; Removal of adrenal glands References Lim SK, Rha KH. Surgery of the adrenal glands.

Amblyopia is the loss of the ability to see clearly through one eye. It is also called "lazy eye." It is the most common cause of vision problems in children. Causes Amblyopia occurs when the nerve pathway from one eye to the brain does not develop during childhood. This problem develops because the abnormal eye sends the wrong image to the brain. This is the case in strabismus (crossed eyes). In other eye problems, a blurred image is sent to the brain. This confuses the brain, and the brain may learn to ignore the image from the weaker eye. Strabismus is the most common cause of amblyopia. Having a family member with strabismus, increases your chance of having strabismus. The term "lazy eye" refers to amblyopia, which often occurs along with strabismus. However, amblyopia can occur due to something other than strabismus. Also, people can have strabismus without amblyopia. Other causes include: Childhood cataracts Farsightedness , nearsightedness , or astigmatism , especially if it is greater in one eye In strabismus, the only problem with the eye itself is that it is pointed in the wrong direction. If poor vision is caused by a problem with the eyeball, such as cataracts, amblyopia will still need to be treated, even if the cataracts are removed. Amblyopia may not develop if both eyes have equally poor vision. Symptoms Symptoms of the condition include: Eyes that turn in or out Eyes that do not appear to work together Inability to judge depth correctly Poor vision in one eye Exams and Tests In most cases, amblyopia can be detected with a complete eye exam. Special tests are not often needed. Treatment The first step will be to correct any eye condition that is causing poor vision in the amblyopic eye (such as cataracts). Children with a refractive error (nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism) will need glasses. Next, a patch is placed on the normal eye. This forces the brain to recognize the image from the eye with amblyopia. Sometimes, drops are used to blur the vision of the normal eye instead of putting a patch on it. Newer treatment techniques use digital computer technology, to show a slightly different image to each eye. Over time, the vision between the eyes becomes equalized. Children whose vision will not fully recover, and those with only one good eye due to any disorder should wear glasses. These glasses should be shatter- and scratch-resistant. Outlook (Prognosis) Children who get treated before age 5 almost always recover vision that is close to normal. However, they may continue to have problems with depth perception. Permanent vision problems may result if treatment is delayed. Children treated after age 10 can expect vision to recover only partially. Possible Complications Complications may include: Eye muscle problems that may require several surgeries Permanent vision loss in the affected eye When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your health care provider or ophthalmologist if you suspect a vision problem in a young child. Prevention Identifying and treating the problem early prevents children from having permanent visual loss. All children should have a complete eye exam at least once between ages 3 and 5. Special methods are used to measure vision in a child who is too young to speak. Most eye care professionals can perform these techniques.

Agammaglobulinemia is an inherited disorder in which a person has very low levels of protective immune system proteins called immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulins are a type of antibody . Low levels of these antibodies make you more likely to get infections. Causes This is a rare disorder that mainly affects males. It is caused by a gene defect that blocks the growth of normal, mature immune cells called B lymphocytes. As a result, the body makes very little (if any) immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulins play a major role in the immune response , which protects against illness and infection. People with this disorder develop infections again and again. Common infections include ones that are due to bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae , pneumococci ( Streptococcus pneumoniae ), and staphylococci. Common sites of infection include: Gastrointestinal tract Joints Lungs Skin Upper respiratory tract Agammaglobulinemia is inherited, which means other people in your family may have the condition. Symptoms Symptoms include frequent episodes of: Bronchitis (airway infection) Conjunctivitis (eye infection) Diarrhea Otitis media (middle ear infection) Pneumonia (lung infection) Sinusitis (sinus infection) Skin infections Upper respiratory tract infections Infections typically appear in the first 4 years of life. Other symptoms include: Bronchiectasis (a disease in which the bronchial tubes in the lungs become damaged and enlarged) Asthma without a known cause Exams and Tests The disorder is confirmed by blood tests that measure levels of immunoglobulins. Tests include: Flow cytometry to measure circulating B lymphocytes Immunoelectrophoresis - serum Quantitative immunoglobulins - IgG, IgA, IgM (usually measured by nephelometry) Treatment Treatment involves taking steps to reduce the number and severity of infections. Antibiotics are often needed to treat bacterial infections. Immunoglobulins are given through a vein or by injection to boost the immune system. A bone marrow transplant may be considered. Support Groups More information and support for people with agammaglobulinemia and their families can be found at: Immune Deficiency Foundation -- primaryimmune.org National Organization for Rare Disorders -- rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/agammaglobulinemia/ NIH Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center -- rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/1033/x-linked-agammaglobulinemia Outlook (Prognosis) Treatment with immunoglobulins has greatly improved the health of those who have this disorder. Without treatment, most severe infections are deadly. Possible Complications Health problems that may result include: Arthritis Chronic sinus or pulmonary disease Eczema Intestinal malabsorption syndromes When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your health care provider for an appointment if: You or your child has experienced frequent infections. You have a family history of agammaglobulinemia or another immunodeficiency disorder and you are planning to have children. Ask the provider about genetic counseling. Prevention Genetic counseling should be offered to prospective parents with a family history of agammaglobulinemia or other immunodeficiency disorders .

Atelectasis is the collapse of part or, much less commonly, all of a lung. Causes Atelectasis is caused by a blockage of the air passages (bronchus or bronchioles) or by pressure on the outside of the lung. Atelectasis is not the same as another type of collapsed lung called pneumothorax , which occurs when air escapes from the lung. The air then fills the space outside of the lung, between the lung and chest wall. In atelectasis, there is usually fluid between the lung and the chest wall and the air sacs within the lung fill with fluid. Atelectasis is common after surgery or in people who are or were in the hospital. Risk factors for developing atelectasis include: Anesthesia Use of a breathing tube Foreign object in the airway (most common in children) Lung disease Mucus that plugs the airway Pressure on the lung caused by a buildup of fluid between the ribs and the lungs (called a pleural effusion ) Prolonged bed rest with few changes in position Shallow breathing (may be caused by painful breathing or muscle weakness) Tumors that block an airway Symptoms Symptoms may include any of the following: Breathing difficulty Chest pain Cough There are no symptoms if atelectasis is mild. Exams and Tests To confirm if you have atelectasis and determine its cause, the following tests will likely be done to view the lungs and airways: Physical exam by auscultating (listening) or percussing (tapping) the chest Bronchoscopy Chest CT or MRI scan Chest x-ray Ultrasound of chest Treatment The goal of treatment is to treat the underlying cause and re-expand the collapsed lung tissue. If fluid is putting pressure on the lung, removing the fluid may allow the lung to expand. Treatments include one or more of the following: Clap ( percussion ) on the chest to loosen mucus plugs in the airway. Deep breathing exercises (with the help of incentive spirometry devices ). Remove or relieve any blockage in the airways by bronchoscopy . Tilt the person so the head is lower than the chest (called postural drainage). This allows mucus to drain more easily. Treat a tumor or other condition. Turn the person to lie on the healthy side, allowing the collapsed area of lung to re-expand. Use inhaled medicines to open the airway. Use other devices that help increase positive pressure in the airways and clear fluids. Be physically active if possible Outlook (Prognosis) In an adult, atelectasis in a small area of the lung is usually not life threatening. The rest of the lung can make up for the collapsed area, bringing in enough oxygen for the body to function. Large areas of atelectasis may be life threatening, often in a baby or small child, or in someone who has another lung disease or illness. The collapsed lung usually reinflates slowly if the airway blockage has been removed. Scarring or damage may remain. The outlook depends on the underlying disease. For example, people with extensive cancer often don't do well, while those with simple atelectasis after surgery have a very good outcome. Possible Complications Pneumonia may develop quickly after atelectasis in the affected part of the lung. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your health care provider right away if you develop symptoms of atelectasis. Prevention To prevent atelectasis: Encourage movement and deep breathing in anyone who is bedridden for long periods. Keep small objects out of the reach of young children. Maintain deep breathing after anesthesia. Alternative Names Partial lung collapse Images Bronchoscopy Lungs Respiratory system References Carlsen KH, Crowley S, Smevik B. Atelectasis.

Angioedema is swelling that is similar to hives , but the swelling is under the skin instead of on the surface. Hives are often called welts. They are a surface swelling. It is possible to have angioedema without hives, and many times angioedema can come with hives. Causes Angioedema may be caused by an allergic reaction . Angioedema typically is not itchy while hives are very itchy. During the reaction, histamine and other chemicals are released into the bloodstream. The body releases histamine when the immune system detects a foreign substance called an allergen . However, in most cases, the cause of angioedema is never found. The following may cause angioedema: Allergies due to animal dander ( scales of shed skin), foods, insect bites or pollen Exposure to water, sunlight, cold or heat Medicines ( drug allergy ) such as antibiotics (penicillin and sulfa drugs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and certain blood pressure medicines (ACE inhibitors) Autoimmune diseases such as lupus Hives and angioedema may also occur after infections. Angioedema may occur alone or with other illnesses (including autoimmune disorders such as lupus, leukemia , and lymphoma). A rare form of angioedema runs in families and has different triggers, complications, and treatments. This is called hereditary angioedema . Symptoms The main symptom is sudden swelling below the skin surface. Welts or swelling on the surface of the skin can also develop. The swelling usually occurs around the eyes and lips. It may also be found on the hands, feet, and throat. The swelling may form a line or be more spread out. The welts are painful and may be itchy. This is known as hives (urticaria). They turn pale and swell if irritated. The deeper swelling of angioedema may also be painful. Other symptoms may include: Abdominal cramping Breathing difficulty Swollen eyes and mouth Swollen lining of the eyes ( chemosis ) Exams and Tests The health care provider will look at your skin and ask if you have been exposed to any irritating substances. If your throat is affected, a physical exam might reveal abnormal sounds ( stridor ) when you breathe in. Blood tests or allergy testing may be ordered, but often no cause of the swelling or hives is found. Treatment Mild symptoms may not need treatment. Moderate to severe symptoms may need to be treated. Breathing difficulty is an emergency condition. People with angioedema should: Avoid any known allergen or trigger that causes their symptoms. Avoid any medicines, herbs, or supplements that are not prescribed by a provider. Cool compresses or soaks can relieve pain. Medicines used to treat angioedema include: Antihistamines Anti-inflammatory medicines (corticosteroids) Epinephrine injectors (people with a history of severe symptoms may need to carry these with them in case of a severe reaction) Inhaler medicines that help open up the airways If the person has trouble breathing, seek medical help right away. A severe, life-threatening airway blockage may occur if the throat swells. Outlook (Prognosis) Angioedema that does not affect the breathing may be uncomfortable. It is usually harmless and goes away in a few days. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if: Angioedema does not respond to treatment It is severe You have never had angioedema before Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if there are any of the following symptoms: Abnormal breathing sounds Difficulty breathing or wheezing Fainting Alternative Names Angioneurotic edema; Welts; Allergic reaction - angioedema; Hives - angioedema References Barksdale AN, Ross W.

Aortopulmonary window is a rare heart defect in which there is a hole connecting the major artery taking blood from the heart to the body (the aorta) and the one taking blood from the heart to the lungs (pulmonary artery). The condition is congenital, which means it is present at birth. Causes Normally, blood flows through the pulmonary artery into the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. Then the blood travels back to the heart and is pumped to the aorta and the rest of the body. Babies with an aortopulmonary window have a hole in between the aorta and pulmonary artery. Because of this hole, blood from the aorta flows into the pulmonary artery, and as a result too much blood flows to the lungs. This causes high blood pressure in the lungs (a condition called pulmonary hypertension) and congestive heart failure. The bigger the defect, the more blood that is able to enter the pulmonary artery. The condition occurs when the aorta and pulmonary artery do not divide normally as the baby develops in the womb. Aortopulmonary window is very rare. It accounts for less than 1% of all congenital heart defects. This condition can occur on its own or with other heart defects such as: Tetralogy of Fallot Pulmonary atresia Truncus arteriosus Atrial septal defect Patent ductus arteriosus Interrupted aortic arch Fifty percent of people usually have no other heart defects. Symptoms If the defect is small, it may not cause any symptoms. However, most defects are large. Symptoms can include: Delayed growth Heart failure Irritability Poor eating and lack of weight gain Rapid breathing Rapid heartbeat Respiratory infections Exams and Tests The health care provider will usually hear an abnormal heart sound (murmur) when listening to the child's heart with a stethoscope. The provider may order tests such as: Cardiac catheterization -- a thin tube inserted into blood vessels and/or arteries around the heart to view the heart and blood vessels and directly measure pressure in the heart and lungs. Chest x-ray . Echocardiogram . MRI of the heart . Treatment The condition usually requires open heart surgery to repair the defect. Surgery should be done as soon as possible after the diagnosis is made. In most cases, this is when the child is still a newborn. During the procedure, a heart-lung machine takes over for the child's heart. The surgeon opens the aorta and closes the defect with a patch made either from a piece of the sac that encloses the heart (the pericardium) or a man-made material. Outlook (Prognosis) Surgery to correct aortopulmonary window is successful in most cases. If the defect is treated quickly, the child should not have any lasting effects. Possible Complications Delaying treatment can lead to complications such as: Congestive heart failure Pulmonary hypertension or Eisenmenger syndrome Death When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if your child has symptoms of aortopulmonary window. The sooner this condition is diagnosed and treated, the better the child's prognosis. Prevention There is no known way to prevent aortopulmonary window.

You had surgery to replace your damaged ankle joint with an artificial joint. This article tells you how to take care of yourself when you go home from the hospital. When You're in the Hospital You had an ankle replacement. Your surgeon removed and reshaped damaged bones, and put in an artificial ankle joint. You received pain medicine and were shown how to treat swelling around your new ankle joint. What to Expect at Home Your ankle area may feel warm and tender for 4 to 6 weeks. You will need help with daily chores such as driving, shopping, bathing, making meals, housework for up to 6 weeks. Be sure to check with your health care providers before you return to any of these activities. You will need to keep weight off of the foot for 10 to 12 weeks. Recovery can take 3 to 6 months. It may take up to 6 months before you return to normal activity levels. Activity Your provider will ask you to rest when you first go home. Keep your leg propped up on one or two pillows. Place the pillows below your foot or calf muscle. This helps reduce swelling. It is very important to elevate your leg. Keeping it above heart level will reduce swelling. Swelling can lead to poor wound healing and other surgery complications. You will be asked to keep all weight off of your foot for 10 to 12 weeks. You will need to use a walker or crutches. You can also use a knee scooter to avoid putting weight on your ankle. You will need to wear a cast or a splint. Take the cast or splint off only when your provider or physical therapist says it is OK. Try not to stand for long periods. Do the exercises your doctor or physical therapist showed you. You will go to physical therapy to help your recovery. You will start with a range of motion exercises for your ankle. You will learn exercises to strengthen the muscles around your ankle next. Your therapist will slowly increase the amount and type of activities as you build strength. Do not start heavier exercises, such as jogging, swimming, aerobics, or bicycling, until your provider or therapist tells you it is OK. Ask your provider when it will be safe for you to return to work or drive. Wound Care Your sutures (stitches) will be removed about 1 to 2 weeks after surgery. You should keep your incision clean and dry for 2 weeks. Keep your bandage on your wound clean and dry. You may change the dressing every day if you like. Do not shower until after your follow-up appointment. Your provider will tell you when you can begin taking showers. When you do start showering again, let the water run over the incision. Do not scrub. Do not soak the wound in the bath or a hot tub. Pain You will receive a prescription for pain medicine. Get it filled when you go home so you have it when you need it. Take your pain medicine when you start having pain so the pain does not get too bad. Taking ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or another anti-inflammatory medicine may also help. Talk to your provider about what other medicines you can take with your pain medicine. When to Call the Doctor Contact your provider if you notice: Bleeding that soaks through your dressing and does not stop when you put pressure over the area Pain that does not go away with your pain medicine Swelling or pain in your calf muscle Foot or toes that appear darker or are cool to the touch Redness, pain, swelling, or yellowish discharge from the wound sites Fever that is higher than 101°F (38.3°C) Shortness of breath or chest pain Your ankle feels unstable or out of position Alternative Names Ankle arthroplasty - total - discharge; Total ankle arthroplasty - discharge; Endoprosthetic ankle replacement - discharge; Osteoarthritis - ankle Images Ankle replacement References Bettin CC.

An arteriogram is an imaging test that uses x-rays and a special dye to see inside the arteries. It can be used to view arteries in the heart, brain, kidney, and other parts of the body. Related tests include: Aortic angiography (chest or abdomen) Cerebral angiography (brain) Coronary angiography (heart) Extremity angiography (legs or arms) Pulmonary angiography (lungs) Renal arteriography (kidneys) Mesenteric angiography (colon or small bowel) Pelvic angiography (pelvis) Hepatic angiography (liver) How the Test is Performed The test is done in a medical facility designed to perform this test. You will lie on an x-ray table. Local anesthetic is used to numb the area where the dye is injected. Most of the time, an artery in the groin will be used. In some cases, an artery in your wrist may be used. Next, a flexible tube called a catheter (which is the width of the tip of a pen) is inserted into the artery in the groin and moved through the artery until it reaches the intended area of the body. The exact procedure depends on the part of the body being examined. You will not feel the catheter inside of you. You may ask for a calming medicine (sedative) if you are anxious about the test. For most tests: A dye (contrast) is injected into an artery. X-rays are taken to see how the dye flows through your bloodstream. How to Prepare for the Test How you should prepare depends on the part of the body being examined. Your health care provider may tell you to stop taking certain medicines that could affect the test, or blood thinning medicines. DO NOT stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider. In most cases, you may not be able to eat or drink anything for a few hours before the test. How the Test will Feel You may have some discomfort from a needle stick. The needle stick will usually be in the groin or wrist. You may feel symptoms such as flushing in the face or other parts of the body when the dye is injected. The exact symptoms will depend on the part of the body being examined. If you had an injection in your groin area, you will most often be asked to lie flat on your back for a few hours after the test. This is to help avoid bleeding. Lying flat may be uncomfortable for some people. Why the Test is Performed An arteriogram is done to see how blood moves through the arteries. It is also used to check for blocked or damaged arteries. It can be used to visualize tumors or find a source of bleeding. Usually, an arteriogram is performed at the same time as a treatment. If no treatment is planned, in many areas of the body it has been replaced with CT or MR arteriography.

Alkaptonuria is a rare condition in which a person's urine turns a dark brownish-black color when exposed to air. Alkaptonuria is part of a group of conditions known as an inborn error of metabolism . Causes A defect in the HGD gene causes alkaptonuria. The gene defect makes the body unable to properly break down the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine. As a result, a substance called homogentisic acid builds up in the skin and other body tissues. The acid leaves the body through the urine. The urine turns brownish-black when it mixes with air. Alkaptonuria is inherited, which means it is passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease. Symptoms Urine in an infant's diaper may darken and can turn almost black after several hours. However, many people with this condition may not know they have it. The disease is most often discovered in mid-adulthood (around age 40), when joint and other problems occur. Symptoms may include: Arthritis (especially of the spine) that gets worse over time Darkening of the ear Dark spots on the white of the eye and cornea Exams and Tests A urine test is done to test for alkaptonuria. If ferric chloride is added to the urine, it will turn the urine black in people with this condition. Treatment Management of alkaptonuria has traditionally been focused on controlling symptoms. Eating a low protein diet may be helpful, but many people find this restriction difficult. Medicines, such as NSAIDs and physical therapy may help relieve joint pain. Clinical trials are underway for other drugs to treat this condition and to assess whether the drug nitisinone provides long-term help with this illness. Outlook (Prognosis) The outcome is expected to be good. Possible Complications The build-up of homogentisic acid in the cartilage causes arthritis in many adults with alkaptonuria. Homogentisic acid also can build up on the heart valves, especially the mitral valve. This can sometimes lead to the need for valve replacement. Coronary artery disease may develop earlier in life in people with alkaptonuria. Kidney stones and prostate stones may be more common in people with alkaptonuria. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your health care provider if you notice that your own urine or your child's urine becomes dark brown or black when it is exposed to air. Prevention Genetic counseling is recommended for people with a family history of alkaptonuria who are considering having children. A blood test can be done to see if you carry the gene for alkaptonuria. Prenatal tests (amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling) can be done to screen a developing baby for this condition if the genetic change has been identified.

Apert syndrome is a genetic disease in which the seams between the skull bones close earlier than normal. This affects the shape of the head and face. Children with Apert syndrome often have deformities of the hands and feet as well. Causes Apert syndrome can be passed down through families (inherited) as an autosomal dominant trait. This means that only one parent needs to pass on the altered gene to a child to have the condition. Most cases may occur without a known family history. Apert syndrome is caused by one of two changes to the FGFR2 gene. This gene change causes some of the bony sutures of the skull to close too early. This condition is called craniosynostosis . Symptoms Symptoms include: Early closure of sutures between bones of the skull, noted by ridging along sutures (craniosynostosis) Frequent ear infections Fusion or severe webbing of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th fingers, often called "mitten hands" Hearing loss Large or late-closing soft spot on a baby's skull (fontanelle) Possible, slow intellectual development (varies from person to person) Prominent or bulging eyes Severe under-development of the midface Skeletal (limb) abnormalities Short height Webbing or fusion of the toes Several other syndromes can lead to a similar appearance of the face and head, but do not include the severe hand and foot features of Apert syndrome. These similar syndromes include: Carpenter syndrome (kleeblattschadel, cloverleaf skull deformity) Crouzon disease (craniofacial dysostosis) Pfeiffer syndrome Saethre-Chotzen syndrome Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. Hand, foot, and skull x-rays will be done. Hearing tests should always be performed. Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis of Apert syndrome. Treatment Treatment consists of surgery to correct abnormal bone growth of the skull, as well as for the fusion of the fingers and toes. Children with this disorder should be examined by a specialized craniofacial surgery team at a children's medical center. A hearing specialist should be consulted if there are hearing problems. Support Groups More information and support for people with Apert syndrome and their families can be found at: Children's Craniofacial Association: ccakids.org When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you have a family history of Apert syndrome or you notice your baby's skull is not developing normally. Prevention Genetic counseling may be helpful if you have a family history of this disorder and are planning to become pregnant. Your provider can test your baby for this disease during pregnancy.

An anastomosis is a surgical connection between two structures. It usually means a connection that is created between tubular structures, such as blood vessels or loops of intestine. For example, when part of an intestine is surgically removed, the two remaining ends are sewn or stapled together (anastomosed). The procedure is known as an intestinal anastomosis. Information Examples of surgical anastomoses are: Arteriovenous fistula (an opening created between an artery and vein) for dialysis Colostomy (an opening created between the bowel and the skin of the abdominal wall) Intestinal, in which two ends of intestine are sewn together A connection between a graft and a blood vessel to create a bypass Images Gastrectomy Before and after small intestine anastomosis References Galandiuk S, Netz U,  Morpurgo E, Tosato SM, Abu-Freha N, Ellis CT.

The acid-fast stain is a laboratory test that determines if a sample of tissue, blood, or other body substance is infected with the bacteria that causes tuberculosis (TB) and other illnesses. How the Test is Performed Depending on where the infection may be in your body, your health care provider will collect one of these samples: Urine Stool Sputum Bone marrow Tissue The sample is then sent to a laboratory. Some of the sample is placed on a glass slide, stained, and heated. The cells in the sample hold onto the dye. The slide is then washed with an acid solution and a different stain is applied. Bacteria that hold onto the first dye are considered "acid-fast" because they resist the acid wash. These types of bacteria are associated with TB and other infections. How to Prepare for the Test Preparation depends on how the sample is collected. Your provider will tell you how to prepare. How the Test will Feel How much discomfort you may feel depends on how the sample is collected. Your provider will discuss this with you. Why the Test is Performed The test can tell if you are likely infected with the bacteria that cause TB and related infections. Normal Results A normal result means no acid-fast bacteria were found on the stained sample. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test result. What Abnormal Results Mean Abnormal results may be due to: TB Leprosy Nocardia infections (also caused by a bacteria) Risks Risks depend on how the sample is collected. Ask your provider to explain the risks and benefits of the medical procedure. References Fitzgerald DW, Sterling TR, Haas DW. Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In: Bennett JE, Dolin R, Blaser MJ, eds.

This is a test that measures the amount of amylase in urine. Amylase is an enzyme that helps digest carbohydrates. It is produced mainly in the pancreas and the glands that make saliva. Amylase may also be measured with a blood test . How the Test is Performed A urine sample is needed. The test may be performed using: Clean-catch urine test 24-hour urine collection How to Prepare for the Test Many medicines can interfere with test results. Your health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test. Do not stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first. How the Test will Feel The test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort. Why the Test is Performed This test is sometimes done to help diagnose pancreatitis and other diseases that affect the pancreas. Normal Results The normal range is 2.6 to 21.2 international units per hour (IU/h). Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. The example above shows the common measurement range for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens. What Abnormal Results Mean An increased amount of amylase in the urine is called amylasuria. Increased urine amylase levels may be a sign of: Acute pancreatitis Alcohol consumption Cancer of the pancreas , ovaries, or lungs Cholecystitis Ectopic or ruptured tubal pregnancy Gallbladder disease Infection of the salivary glands (called sialoadenitis, may be caused by bacteria, mumps or a blockage) Intestinal obstruction Pancreatic duct obstruction Pelvic inflammatory disease Perforated ulcer Decreased amylase levels may be due to: Damage to the pancreas Kidney disease Macroamylasemia Images Female urinary tract Male urinary tract Amylase urine test References Siddiqi HA, Rabinowitz S, Axiotis CA.

Amebic liver abscess is a collection of pus in the liver in response to an intestinal parasite called Entamoeba histolytica . Causes Amebic liver abscess is caused by a parasite called Entamoeba histolytica. This parasite causes amebiasis , an intestinal infection that is also called amebic dysentery. After an infection has occurred, the parasite may be carried by the bloodstream from the intestines to the liver. Amebiasis spreads from eating food or water that has been contaminated with feces. This is sometimes due to the use of human waste as fertilizer. Amebiasis is also spread through person-to-person contact. The infection occurs worldwide. It is most common in tropical areas where crowded living conditions and poor sanitation exist. Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and India have significant health problems from this disease. Risk factors for amebic liver abscess include: Recent travel to a tropical region Alcoholism Cancer Immunosuppression , including HIV/AIDS infection Malnutrition Old age Pregnancy Steroid use Symptoms There are usually no symptoms of intestinal infection. But people with amebic liver abscess do have symptoms, including: Abdominal pain, more so in the right, upper part of the abdomen; pain is intense, continuous or stabbing Cough Fever and chills Diarrhea, non-bloody (in only one-third of people with amebic liver abscess) General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling ( malaise ) Hiccups that do not stop (rare) Jaundice (yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes, or eyes) Loss of appetite Sweating Weight loss Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical examination. You'll be asked about your symptoms and recent travel. Tests that may be done include: Abdominal ultrasound Abdominal CT scan or MRI Complete blood count Liver abscess aspiration to check for bacterial infection in the liver abscess Liver scan Liver function tests Blood test for amebiasis Stool testing for amebiasis Treatment Antibiotics such as metronidazole (Flagyl) or tinidazole (Tindamax) are the usual treatment for liver abscess. A medicine such as paromomycin or diloxanide must also be taken to get rid of all the ameba in the intestine and to prevent the disease from coming back. This treatment can usually wait until after the abscess has been treated. In rare cases, the abscess may need to be drained using a catheter or surgery to relieve some of the abdominal pain and to increase chances of treatment success. Outlook (Prognosis) Without treatment, the abscess may break open (rupture) and spread into other organs, leading to death. People who are treated have a very high chance of a complete cure or only minor complications. Possible Complications The abscess may rupture into the abdominal cavity, the lining of the lungs, the lungs, or the sac around the heart. The infection can also spread to the brain. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you develop symptoms of this disease, especially if you have recently traveled to an area where the disease is known to occur. Prevention When traveling in tropical countries with poor sanitation, drink purified water and do not eat uncooked vegetables or unpeeled fruit.

Actinic keratosis is a small, rough, raised area on your skin. Often this area has been exposed to the sun over a long period of time. Some actinic keratoses may develop into a type of skin cancer. Causes Actinic keratosis is caused by exposure to sunlight. You are more likely to develop it if you: Have fair skin, blue or green eyes, or blond or red hair Had a kidney or other organ transplant Take medicines that suppress the immune system Spend a lot of time each day in the sun (for example, if you work outdoors) Had many severe sunburns early in life Are older Symptoms Actinic keratosis is usually found on the face, scalp, back of the hands, chest, or places that are often in the sun. The skin changes begin as flat and scaly areas. They often have a white or yellow crusty scale on top. The growths may be gray, pink, red, or the same color as your skin. Later, they may become hard and wart-like or gritty and rough. The affected areas may be easier to feel than see. Exams and Tests Your health care provider will look at your skin to diagnose this condition. A skin biopsy may be done to see if it is cancer. Treatment Some actinic keratoses become squamous cell skin cancer . Have your provider look at all skin growths as soon as you find them. Your provider will tell you how to treat them. Growths may be removed by: Burning (electrical cautery) Scraping away the lesion and using electricity to kill any remaining cells (called curettage and electrodesiccation) Cutting the tumor out and using stitches to place the skin back together (called excision) Freezing (cryotherapy, which freezes and kills the cells) If you have many of these skin growths, your doctor may recommend: A special light treatment called photodynamic therapy Chemical peels Skin creams, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and imiquimod Outlook (Prognosis) A small number of these skin growths turn into squamous cell carcinoma. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if you see or feel a rough or scaly spot on your skin, or if you notice any other skin changes. Prevention The best way to lower your risk for actinic keratosis and skin cancer is to learn how to protect your skin from sun and ultraviolet (UV) light . Things you can do to lower your exposure to sunlight include: Wear clothing such as hats, long-sleeved shirts, long skirts, or pants. Try to avoid being in the sun during midday, when ultraviolet light is most intense. Use high-quality sunscreens, preferably with a sun protection factor (SPF) rating of at least 30. Pick a broad-spectrum sunscreen that blocks both UVA and UVB light. Apply sunscreen before going out into the sun, and reapply often -- at least every 2 hours while in the sun. Use sunscreen year-round, including in the winter. Avoid sun lamps, tanning beds, and tanning salons. Other things to know about sun exposure: Sun exposure is stronger in or near surfaces that reflect light, such as water, sand, snow, concrete, and areas painted white. Sunlight is more intense at the beginning of the summer. Skin burns faster at higher altitudes.

Asthma quick-relief medicines work fast to control asthma symptoms. You take them when you are coughing, wheezing, having trouble breathing, or having an asthma attack. They are also called rescue medicines. Many of these medicines are called "bronchodilators" because they open (dilate) and help relax the muscles of your airways (bronchi). You and your health care provider can make a plan for the quick-relief medicines that work for you. This plan will include when you should take them and how much you should take. Plan ahead. Make sure you do not run out. Bring enough medicine with you when you travel. Short-acting Beta-agonists Short-acting beta-agonists are the most common quick-relief medicines for treating asthma attacks and are considered to be bronchodilators. They can be used just before exercising to help prevent asthma symptoms caused by exercise. They work by relaxing the muscles of your airways, and this lets you breathe better during an attack. Tell your provider if you are using quick-relief medicines twice a week or more to control your asthma symptoms. Your asthma may not be under control, and your provider may need to change your dose of daily control medicines. Some quick-relief asthma medicines include: Albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA) Levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA) Metaproterenol Terbutaline Short-acting beta-agonists may cause these side effects: Anxiety. Fast and irregular heartbeats . Call your provider right away if you have this side effect. Headache . Restlessness. Tremor (your hand or another part of your body may shake). Oral Steroids Your provider might prescribe oral steroids when you have an asthma attack that is not going away. These are medicines that you take by mouth as pills, capsules, or liquids. Oral steroids are not quick-relief medicines but are often given for 7 to 14 days when your symptoms flare-up. Oral steroids include: Methylprednisolone Prednisone Prednisolone Alternative Names Asthma - quick-relief drugs - short-acting beta-agonists; Asthma - quick-relief drugs - bronchodilators; Asthma - quick-relief drugs - oral steroids; Asthma - rescue drugs; Bronchial asthma - quick relief; Reactive airway disease - quick relief; Exercise-induced asthma - quick relief Images Asthma quick-relief drugs Lungs Asthmatic bronchiole and normal bronchiole References Drazen JM, Bel EH.

Abdominal ultrasound is a type of imaging test. It is used to look at organs in the abdomen, including the liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and kidneys. The blood vessels that lead to some of these organs, such as the inferior vena cava and aorta, can also be examined with ultrasound. How the Test is Performed An ultrasound machine makes images of organs and structures inside the body. The machine sends out high-frequency sound waves that reflect off body structures. A computer receives these waves and uses them to create a picture. Unlike with x-rays or CT scans , this test does not expose you to ionizing radiation. You will be lying down for the procedure. A clear, water-based conducting gel is applied to the skin over the abdomen. This helps with the transmission of the sound waves. A handheld probe called a transducer is then moved over the abdomen. You may need to change position so that the health care provider can look at different areas. You may also need to hold your breath for short periods during the exam. Most of the time, the test takes less than 30 minutes. How to Prepare for the Test How you will prepare for the test depends on the problem. You will likely be asked not to eat or drink for several hours before the exam. Your health care provider will go over what you need to do. How the Test will Feel There is little discomfort. The conducting gel may feel a little cold and wet. The sonographer may press the probe against your abdomen. Why the Test is Performed You may have this test to: Find the cause of abdominal pain Find the cause of kidney infections Diagnose or monitor tumors and cancers Diagnose or treat ascites Learn why there is swelling of an abdominal organ Look for damage after an injury Look for stones in the gallbladder or kidney Look for the cause of abnormal blood tests such as liver function tests or kidney tests Look for the cause of a fever The reason for the test will depend on your symptoms. Normal Results The organs examined appear normal. What Abnormal Results Mean The meaning of abnormal results depends on the organ being examined and the type of problem. Talk to your provider if you have any questions or concerns. An abdominal ultrasound can indicate conditions such as: Abdominal aortic aneurysm Abscess Appendicitis Cholecystitis Gallstones Hydronephrosis Kidney stones Pancreatitis (inflammation in pancreas) Spleen enlargement ( splenomegaly ) Portal hypertension Liver tumors Obstruction of bile ducts Cirrhosis Risks There is no known risk.

The Achilles tendon connects your calf muscles to your heel bone. Together, they help you push your heel off the ground and go up on your toes. You use these muscles and your Achilles tendon when you walk, run, and jump. If your Achilles tendon stretches too far, it can tear or rupture. If this happens, you may: Hear a snapping, cracking, or popping sound and feel a sharp pain in the back of your leg or ankle Have trouble moving your foot to walk or go up stairs Have difficulty standing on your toes Have bruising or swelling in your leg or foot Feel like the back of your ankle was hit with a bat About Your Injury Most likely your injury occurred when you: Suddenly pushed your foot off the ground, to go from walking to running, or to running uphill Tripped and fell, or had another accident Played a sport like tennis or basketball, with a lot of stopping and sharp turns Most injuries can be diagnosed during a physical exam. You may need an MRI scan to see the location of your Achilles tendon tear. An MRI is a type of imaging test. A partial tear means at least some of the tendon is still OK. A full tear means your tendon is torn completely and the 2 sides are not attached to each other. What to Expect If you have a complete tear, you may need surgery to repair your tendon . Your doctor will discuss the pros and cons of surgery with you. Before surgery, you will wear a special boot that keeps you from moving your lower leg and foot. For a partial tear: You may need surgery. Instead of surgery, you may need to wear a splint or boot for about 6 weeks. During this time, your tendon grows back together. If you have a leg brace, splint, or boot, it will keep you from moving your foot. This will prevent further injury. You can walk once your doctor says it is OK to. Symptom Relief To relieve swelling: Put an ice pack on the area right after you injure it. Use pillows to raise your leg above the level of your heart when you sleep. Keep your foot elevated when you are sitting. Use a boot for walking or crutches to take weight off your ankle. You can take ibuprofen (such as Advil or Motrin), naproxen (such as Aleve or Naprosyn), or acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) for pain. Remember to: Talk with your health care provider if you have heart disease, liver disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or bleeding. Consider quitting smoking (smoking can affect healing after surgery). Not give aspirin to children under 19. Not take more pain killer than the dosage recommended on the bottle or by your provider. Rehab and Activity At some point as you recover, your provider will ask you to begin moving your heel. This may be as soon as 2 to 3 weeks or as long 6 weeks after your injury. With the help of physical therapy, most people can return to normal activity in 4 to 6 months. In physical therapy, you will learn exercises to make your calf muscles stronger and your Achilles tendon more flexible. When you stretch your calf muscles, do so slowly. Also, do not bounce or use too much force when you use your leg. After you heal, you are at greater risk for injuring your Achilles tendon again. You will need to: Stay in good shape and stretch before any exercise Avoid high-heeled shoes Ask your provider if it is OK for you to play tennis, racquetball, basketball, and other sports where you stop and start Do a proper amount of warm up and stretching ahead of time When to Call the Doctor Call your provider if you have any of these symptoms: Swelling or pain in your leg, ankle, or foot becomes worse Purple color to leg or foot Fever Swelling in your calf and foot Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Also call your provider if you have questions or concerns that cannot wait until your next visit.

The appearance of the face and neck typically changes with age. Loss of muscle tone and thinning skin gives the face a flabby or drooping appearance. In some people, sagging jowls may create the look of a double chin. Your skin also dries out and the underlying layer of fat shrinks so that your face no longer has a plump, smooth surface. To some extent, wrinkles cannot be avoided. However, sun exposure and cigarette smoking are likely to make them develop more quickly. The number and size of blotches and dark spots on the face increase as well. These pigment changes are largely due to sun exposure. Missing teeth and receding gums change the appearance of the mouth, so your lips may look shrunken. Loss of bone mass in the jaw reduces the size of the lower face and makes your forehead, nose, and mouth more pronounced. Your nose may also lengthen slightly. The ears may lengthen in some people (probably caused by cartilage growth). Men may develop hair in their ears that becomes longer, coarser, and more noticeable as they age. Ear wax becomes drier because there are fewer wax glands in the ears and they produce less oil. The hardened ear wax can block the ear canal and affect your ability to hear. Eyebrows and eyelashes turn gray. As in other parts of the face, the skin around the eyes gets wrinkles, creating crow's feet at the side of the eyes. Fat from the eyelids settles into the eye sockets. This can make your eyes look sunken. The lower eyelids can slacken and bags can develop under your eyes. Weakening of the muscle that supports the upper eyelid can make the eyelids droop. This may limit vision. The outer surface of the eye (cornea) may develop a grayish-white ring. The colored portion of the eye (iris) loses pigment, making most very older people appear to have gray or light blue eyes. Images Changes in face with age References Brodie SE, Francis JH.

Acute cholecystitis is sudden swelling and irritation of the gallbladder. It causes severe belly pain. Causes The gallbladder is an organ that sits below the liver. It stores bile, which is produced in the liver. Your body uses bile to digest fats in the small intestine. Acute cholecystitis occurs when bile becomes trapped in the gallbladder. This often happens because a gallstone blocks the cystic duct, the tube through which bile travels into and out of the gallbladder. When a stone blocks this duct, bile builds up, causing irritation and pressure in the gallbladder. This can lead to swelling and infection. Other causes include: Serious illnesses, such as HIV or diabetes Tumors of the gallbladder (rare) Some people are more at risk for gallstones. Risk factors include: Being female Pregnancy Hormone therapy Older age Being Native American or Hispanic Obesity Losing or gaining weight rapidly Diabetes Sometimes, the bile duct becomes blocked temporarily. When this occurs repeatedly, it can lead to long-term (chronic) cholecystitis . This is swelling and irritation that continues over time. Eventually, the gallbladder becomes thick and hard. It does not store and release bile as well as it did. Symptoms The main symptom is pain in the upper right side or upper middle of your belly that usually lasts at least 30 minutes. You may feel: Sharp, cramping, or dull pain Steady pain Pain that spreads to your back or below your right shoulder blade Other symptoms that may occur include: Clay-colored stools Fever Nausea and vomiting Yellowing of skin and whites of the eyes ( jaundice ) Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. During the physical exam, you will likely have pain when the provider touches your belly. Your provider may order the following blood tests: Amylase and lipase Bilirubin Complete blood count ( CBC ) Liver function tests Imaging tests can show gallstones or inflammation. You may have one or more of these tests: Abdominal ultrasound Abdominal CT scan or MRI scan Abdominal x-ray Oral cholecystogram Gallbladder radionuclide scan Treatment If you have severe belly pain, seek medical attention right away. In the emergency room, you'll be given fluids through a vein. You also may be given antibiotics to fight infection. Cholecystitis may clear up on its own. However, if you have gallstones, you will probably need surgery to remove your gallbladder . Nonsurgical treatment includes: Antibiotics you take at home to fight infection Low-fat diet (if you are able to eat) Pain medicines You may need emergency surgery if you have complications such as: Tissue death ( gangrene ) of the gallbladder A hole that forms in the wall of the gallbladder (perforation) Inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis) Persistent bile duct blockage Inflammation of the common bile duct If you are very ill, a tube may be placed through your belly into your gallbladder to drain it. Once you feel better, your provider may recommend that you have surgery . Outlook (Prognosis) Most people who have surgery to remove their gallbladder recover completely.

An allergy is an immune response, or reaction, to substances (allergens) that are usually not harmful. In someone with allergies, the immune response is oversensitive. When it recognizes an allergen, the immune system launches a response. Chemicals such as histamines are released. These chemicals cause allergy symptoms. One type of medicine that helps relieve allergy symptoms is an antihistamine. What are Antihistamines? Antihistamines are medicines that treat allergy symptoms by blocking the effects of histamine. Antihistamines come as pills, chewable tablets, capsules, liquids, nasal sprays, and eye drops. There are also injectable forms used mainly in health care settings. How Antihistamines Help Antihistamines treat these allergy symptoms: Congestion, runny nose, sneezing, or itching Swelling of the nasal passages Hives and other skin rashes Itchy, runny eyes Treating symptoms can help you or your child to feel better during the day and sleep better at night. How to Take Antihistamines Depending on your symptoms, you can take antihistamines: Every day, to help keep daily symptoms under control Only when you have symptoms Before being exposed to things that often cause your allergy symptoms, such as a pet or certain plants For many people with allergies, symptoms are the worst around 4 a.m. to 6 a.m. Taking an antihistamine at bedtime may help you or your child feel better in the morning during allergy season. What Antihistamine is Right for you? You can buy many different brands and forms of antihistamines without a prescription. Some work for only 4 to 6 hours, while others last for 12 to 24 hours. Some are combined with a decongestant, a medicine that dries up your nasal passages. Ask your health care provider what type of antihistamine and what exact dosage is right for you or your child. Make sure you understand how much to use and how many times a day to use it. Be sure to read the label carefully. Or ask your pharmacist or provider if you have questions. Some antihistamines cause less sleepiness than others. These include cetirizine (Zyrtec), desloratadine (Clarinex), fexofenadine (Allegra), levocetirizine (Xyzal), and loratadine (Claritin). Do not drink alcohol when you are taking antihistamines. Also, remember: Store antihistamines at room temperature, away from heat, direct light, and moisture. Do not freeze antihistamines. Keep all medicines where children cannot reach them. Side Effects of Antihistamines Ask your provider if antihistamines are safe for you or your child, what side effects to watch for, and how antihistamines may affect other medicines you or your child take. Antihistamines are thought to be safe for adults. Most antihistamines are also safe for children older than 2 years old. If you are breastfeeding or pregnant, ask your provider if antihistamines are safe for you. Adults who take antihistamines should know how the medicine affects them before driving or using machinery. If your child is taking antihistamines, make sure the medicine is not affecting your child's ability to learn. There may be special precautions for using antihistamines if you have: Diabetes Enlarged prostate or problems passing urine Epilepsy Heart disease or high blood pressure Increased pressure in the eye ( glaucoma ) Overactive thyroid Side effects of antihistamines may include: Changes in vision , such as blurry vision Constipation Decreased appetite Dizziness Drowsiness Dry mouth Feeling nervous, excited, or irritable Increased difficulty urinating if you already have some difficulty urinating When to Call the Doctor Contact your provider if: Your nose is irritated, you are having nosebleeds, or you have any other new nasal symptoms Your allergy symptoms are not getting better You are having trouble taking your antihistamines Alternative Names Allergic rhinitis - antihistamine; Hives - antihistamine; Allergic conjunctivitis - antihistamine; Urticaria - antihistamine; Dermatitis - antihistamine; Eczema - antihistamine References Corren J, Baroody FM, Togias A.

Arachnodactyly is a condition in which the fingers are long, slender, and curved. They look like the legs of a spider (arachnid). Considerations Long, slender fingers can be normal and not associated with any medical problems. In some cases, however, "spider fingers" can be a sign of an underlying disorder. Causes Causes may include: Homocystinuria Marfan syndrome Other rare genetic disorders When to Contact a Medical Professional Some children are born with arachnodactyly. It may become more evident over time. Talk to your health care provider if your child has long, slender fingers and you are concerned that an underlying condition may exist. What to Expect at Your Office Visit The provider will perform a physical exam. You will be asked questions about the medical history. This includes: When did you first notice the fingers being shaped like this? Is there any family history of early death? Is there any family history of known hereditary disorders? What other symptoms are present? Have you noticed any other unusual things? Diagnostic tests are most often not necessary unless a hereditary disorder is suspected.

Anti-smooth muscle antibody is a blood test that detects the presence of antibodies against smooth muscle. The antibody is useful in making a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis. How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed. This may be taken through a vein. The procedure is called a venipuncture . How to Prepare for the Test No special steps are needed to prepare for this test. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others may feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing. Why the Test is Performed You may need this test if you have signs of certain liver diseases, such as hepatitis and cirrhosis . These conditions can trigger the body to form antibodies against smooth muscle. Anti-smooth muscle antibodies are not often seen in diseases other than autoimmune hepatitis. Therefore, it is helpful to make the diagnosis. Autoimmune hepatitis is treated with immunosuppressive medicines. People with autoimmune hepatitis often have other autoantibodies. These include: Antinuclear antibodies. Anti-actin antibodies. Anti-soluble liver antigen/liver pancreas (anti-SLA/LP) antibodies. Other antibodies may be present, even when the anti-smooth muscle antibodies are absent. The diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis may require a liver biopsy. Normal Results Normally, there are no antibodies present. Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean A positive test may be due to: Chronic active autoimmune hepatitis Cirrhosis Infectious mononucleosis The test also helps distinguish autoimmune hepatitis from systemic lupus erythematosus . Risks Risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Images Blood test Types of muscle tissue References Czaja AJ.

The aortic arch is the top part of the main artery carrying blood away from the heart. Aortic arch syndrome refers to a group of signs and symptoms associated with structural problems in the arteries that branch off the aortic arch. Watch this video about: Heartbeat Causes Aortic arch syndrome problems can be due to trauma, blood clots, or malformations that develop before birth. These defects result in abnormal blood flow to the head, neck, or arms. In children, there are many types of aortic arch syndromes, including: Congenital absence of a branch of the aorta Isolation of the subclavian arteries Vascular rings An inflammatory disease called Takayasu syndrome may result in narrowing (stenosis) of the vessels of the aortic arch. This typically occurs in women and girls. This disease is seen more often in people of Asian descent. Symptoms Symptoms vary according to which artery or other structure that has been affected. Symptoms may include: Blood pressure changes Breathing problems Dizziness, blurred vision, weakness, and other brain and nervous system (neurological) changes Numbness of an arm Reduced pulse Swallowing problems Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) Treatment Surgery is often needed to treat the underlying cause of aortic arch syndrome.

Acquired platelet function defects are conditions that prevent clotting elements in the blood called platelets from working as they should. The term acquired means these conditions are not present at birth. Causes Platelet disorders can affect the number of platelets, how well they function, or both. A platelet disorder affects normal blood clotting. Disorders that can have problems with platelet function include: Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (bleeding disorder in which the immune system destroys platelets) Chronic myelogenous leukemia (blood cancer that starts inside bone marrow) Multiple myeloma (blood cancer that starts in the plasma cells in the bone marrow) Primary myelofibrosis (bone marrow disorder in which the marrow is replaced by fibrous scar tissue) Polycythemia vera (bone marrow disease that leads to an abnormal increase in the number of blood cells) Primary thrombocythemia (bone marrow disorder in which the marrow produces too many platelets) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (blood disorder that causes blood clots to form in small blood vessels) Other causes include: Kidney (renal) failure Medicines such as aspirin, ibuprofen, other anti-inflammatory drugs, penicillin, phenothiazines, and prednisone (after long-term use) Symptoms Symptoms may include any of the following: Heavy menstrual periods or prolonged bleeding (more than 5 days each period) Abnormal vaginal bleeding Blood in the urine Bleeding under the skin Bruising easily or pinpoint red spots on the skin Gastrointestinal bleeding resulting in bloody, dark black, or tarry bowel movements ; or vomiting blood or material that looks like coffee grounds Nosebleeds Exams and Tests Tests that may be done include: Platelet function Platelet count Prothrombin time ( PT ) and partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) Treatment Treatment is aimed at fixing the cause of the problem: Bone marrow disorders are often treated with platelet transfusions or removing platelets from the blood (platelet pheresis). Chemotherapy may be used to treat an underlying condition that is causing the problem. Platelet function defects caused by kidney failure are treated with dialysis or medicines. Platelet problems caused by a certain medicine are treated by stopping the drug. Outlook (Prognosis) Most of the time, treating the cause of the problem corrects the defect. Possible Complications Complications may include: Bleeding that does not stop easily Anemia (due to excessive bleeding) When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your health care provider if: You have bleeding and do not know the cause Your symptoms get worse Your symptoms do not improve after you are treated for an acquired platelet function defect Prevention Using medicines as directed can reduce the risk for drug-related acquired platelet function defects. Treating other disorders may also reduce the risk. Some cases cannot be prevented.

Antifreeze is a liquid used to cool engines. It is also called engine coolant. This article discusses poisoning caused by swallowing antifreeze. This is for information only and not for use in the treatment or management of an actual poison exposure. If you have an exposure, you should call your local emergency number (such as 911) or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. Poisonous Ingredient The poisonous ingredients in antifreeze are: Ethylene glycol Methanol Propylene glycol Where Found The above ingredients are found in various antifreezes. They may also be used in other products. Symptoms Below are symptoms of antifreeze poisoning in different parts of the body. AIRWAYS AND LUNGS Rapid breathing No breathing BLADDER AND KIDNEYS Blood in urine No urine output or decreased urine output EYES, EARS, NOSE, AND THROAT Blurred vision Blindness HEART AND BLOOD Rapid heartbeat Low blood pressure MUSCLES AND JOINTS Leg cramps NERVOUS SYSTEM Coma Convulsions Dizziness Fatigue Headache Slurred speech Stupor (lack of alertness) Unconsciousness Unsteady walk Weakness SKIN Blue lips and fingernails STOMACH AND GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT Nausea and vomiting Home Care Seek medical help right away. DO NOT make a person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to. Use standard first aid and CPR for signs of shock or no heartbeat (cardiac arrest). Call your local poison control center or 911 for more help. Before Calling Emergency Have this information ready: Person's age, weight, and condition Name of product (as well as the ingredients, if known) Time it was swallowed Amount swallowed Poison Control Your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. They will give you further instructions. This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. What to Expect at the Emergency Room Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible. The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. The person may receive: Blood and urine tests Breathing support, including oxygen, tube through the mouth into the throat, and breathing machine Chest x-ray CT scan of the head (computed tomography) ECG (electrocardiogram or heart tracing) Intravenous fluids (through a vein) Medicines to reverse the effects of the poison Tube placed down the nose and into the stomach (sometimes) Dialysis (kidney machine) treatment may be needed during recovery. This need may be permanent if kidney damage is severe. Outlook (Prognosis) For ethylene glycol: Death may occur within the first 24 hours. If the patient survives, there may be little or no urine output for several weeks before the kidneys recover. Kidney damage may be permanent. Any brain damage that occurs also may be permanent. For methanol: Methanol is extremely toxic. As little as 2 tablespoons (1 ounce or 30 milliliters) can kill a child, and 4 to 16 tablespoons (2 to 8 ounces or 60 to 240 milliliters) can be deadly for an adult. The outcome depends on how much was swallowed and how soon appropriate care was given. Vision loss or blindness may be permanent Permanent damage to the nervous system may occur. This can cause blindness, decreased mental functioning, and a condition similar to Parkinson disease. Keep all chemicals, cleaners, and industrial products in their original containers and marked as poison, and out of the reach of children. This will reduce the risk for poisoning and overdose.

Alcohol and pregnancy: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia Skip navigation An official website of the United States government Here’s how you know Here’s how you know Official websites use .gov A .gov website belongs to an official government
              organization in the United States. Secure .gov websites use HTTPS A lock ( Lock Locked padlock icon ) or https:// means you’ve safely connected to

Pregnant women are strongly urged not to drink alcohol during pregnancy. Drinking alcohol while pregnant has been shown to cause harm to a baby as it develops in the womb. Alcohol used during pregnancy may also lead to long-term medical problems and birth defects. Information When a pregnant woman drinks alcohol, the alcohol travels through her blood and into the baby's blood, tissues, and organs. Alcohol breaks down much more slowly in the baby's body than in an adult. That means the baby's blood alcohol level remains increased longer than the mother's. This can harm the baby and can sometimes lead to lifelong damage. DANGERS OF ALCOHOL DURING PREGNANCY Drinking a lot of alcohol during pregnancy can lead to a group of defects in the baby known as fetal alcohol syndrome. Symptoms can include: Behavior and attention problems Heart defects Changes in the shape of the face Poor growth before and after birth Poor muscle tone and problems with movement and balance Problems with thinking and speech Learning problems These medical problems are lifelong and can range from mild to severe. Complications seen in the infant may include: Cerebral palsy Premature delivery Pregnancy loss or stillbirth HOW MUCH ALCOHOL IS SAFE? There is no known "safe" amount of alcohol use during pregnancy. Alcohol use appears to be the most harmful during the first 3 months of pregnancy; however, drinking alcohol anytime during pregnancy can be harmful. Alcohol includes beer, wine, wine coolers, and liquor. One drink is defined as: 12 oz of beer 5 oz of wine 1.5 oz of liquor How much you drink is just as important as how often you drink. Even if you don't drink often, drinking a large amount at one time can harm the baby. Binge drinking (5 or more drinks on one sitting) greatly increases a baby's risk of developing alcohol-related damage. Drinking moderate amounts of alcohol when pregnant may lead to miscarriage. Heavy drinkers (those who drink more than 2 alcoholic beverages a day) are at greater risk of giving birth to a child with fetal alcohol syndrome . The more you drink, the more you raise your baby's risk for harm. DO NOT DRINK DURING PREGNANCY Women who are pregnant or who are trying to get pregnant should avoid drinking any amount of alcohol. The only way to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome is to not drink alcohol during pregnancy. If you did not know you were pregnant and drank alcohol, stop drinking as soon as you learn you are pregnant. The sooner you stop drinking alcohol, the healthier your baby will be. Choose nonalcoholic versions of beverages you like. If you cannot control your drinking, avoid being around other people who are using alcohol. Pregnant women with alcoholism should join an alcohol abuse rehabilitation program . They should also be followed closely by a health care provider.

Vital signs include body temperature, heart rate (pulse), breathing (respiratory) rate, and blood pressure. As you age, your vital signs may change, depending on how healthy you are. Some medical problems can cause changes in one or more vital signs. Checking your vital signs helps your health care provider monitor your health and any medical problems you may have. BODY TEMPERATURE Normal body temperature does not change much with aging. But as you get older, it becomes harder for your body to control its temperature. A decrease in the amount of fat below the skin makes it harder to stay warm. You may need to wear layers of clothing to feel warm. Aging decreases your ability to sweat. You may have difficulty telling when you are becoming overheated. This puts you at high risk of overheating ( heat stroke ). You can also be at risk for dangerous drops in body temperature. Fever is an important sign of illness in older people. It is often the only symptom for several days of an illness. See your provider if you have a fever that is not explained by a known illness. A fever is also a sign of infection. When an older person has an infection, their body may not be able to produce a higher temperature. For this reason, it is important to check other vital signs, as well as any symptoms and signs of infection. HEART RATE AND BREATHING RATE As you grow older, your pulse rate is about the same as before. But when you exercise, it may take longer for your pulse to increase and longer for it to slow down afterward. Your highest heart rate with exercise is also lower than it was when you were younger. Breathing rate usually does not change with age. But lung function decreases slightly each year as you age. Healthy older people can usually breathe without effort. BLOOD PRESSURE Older people may become dizzy when standing up too quickly. This is due to a drop in blood pressure with standing. This kind of drop in blood pressure when standing is called orthostatic hypotension . It is often related to medicines, particularly blood pressure drugs. Risk of having high blood pressure ( hypertension ) increases as you get older. Other heart-related problems common in older adults include: Very slow pulse or very fast pulse Heart rhythm problems such as atrial fibrillation EFFECTS OF MEDICINES ON VITAL SIGNS Medicines that are used to treat health problems in older people can affect the vital signs. For example, the medicine digoxin, which is used for heart failure , and blood pressure medicines called beta-blockers may cause the pulse to slow. Diuretics (water pills) can cause low blood pressure, most often when changing body position too quickly. OTHER CHANGES As you grow older, you will have other changes, including: In organs, tissues, and cells In the heart and blood vessels In the lungs Images Aerobic exercise Taking your carotid pulse Radial pulse Warming up and cooling down Effects of age on blood pressure References Southerland LT, Fath JJ.

Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that moves oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and body tissues. Hemoglobin derivatives are forms of hemoglobin altered by attachment of carbon monoxide or certain drugs. High levels of hemoglobin derivatives prevent adequate transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide and cause illness. This article discusses the test used to detect and measure the amount of hemoglobin derivatives in your blood. How the Test is Performed The test is done using a small needle to collect a sample of blood from a vein or an artery. The sample may be collected from a vein or artery in the wrist, groin, or arm. Before blood is drawn, your health care provider may test circulation to the hand (if the wrist is the site). After the blood is drawn, pressure applied to the puncture site for a few minutes stops the bleeding. How to Prepare for the Test No special preparation is needed. For children, it may help to explain how the test will feel and why it is done. This may make the child feel less nervous. How the Test will Feel You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn. Why the Test is Performed Carboxyhemoglobin is a hemoglobin derivative to which carbon monoxide has attached. High amounts of carboxyhemoglobin ("carbon monoxide poisoning") prevent the normal movement of oxygen and carbon dioxide by the blood. Carbon monoxide is released in the exhaust from cars, trucks, small engines, stoves, lanterns, grills, fireplaces, gas ranges, and furnaces. In closed spaces such as homes or garages that are not adequately ventilated, carbon monoxide can build up to dangerous levels. Sulfhemoglobin and methemoglobin are rare hemoglobin derivatives to which oxygen cannot attach. They may occur when you take certain medicines such as dapsone, metoclopramide, nitrates, or sulfonamides. Normal Results Some levels of hemoglobin derivatives may be normal: Carboxyhemoglobin -- less than 1.5% (but may be as high as 9% in smokers) Methemoglobin -- less than 2% Sulfhemoglobin -- undetectable Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean High levels of hemoglobin derivatives can lead to major health problems. Carboxyhemoglobin: 10% to 20% -- symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning begin to appear 30% -- symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning may be severe 50% to 80% -- potentially deadly Methemoglobin: 10% to 25% -- bluish skin color (cyanosis) 35% to 40% -- shortness of breath and headache Over 60% -- lethargy and stupor Over 70% -- potentially deadly Sulfhemoglobin: Values of greater than 10 grams per deciliter (g/dL) or 6.2 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) cause bluish skin color, but do not usually cause harmful effects.

Acetylcholine receptor antibody is a protein found in the blood of many people with myasthenia gravis . The antibody affects the part of nerve cells that send signals from nerves to muscles. This article discusses the blood test for acetylcholine receptor antibody. How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed. Most of the time, blood is drawn from a vein located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. How to Prepare for the Test Most of the time you do not need to take special steps before this test. How the Test will Feel You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn. Why the Test is Performed This test is used to help diagnose myasthenia gravis . Normal Results Normally, there is no acetylcholine receptor antibody (or less than 0.05 nmol/L) in the bloodstream. Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results. The example above shows the common measurement for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens. What Abnormal Results Mean An abnormal result means acetylcholine receptor antibody has been found in your blood. It confirms the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis in people who have symptoms. Nearly one half of people with myasthenia gravis that is limited to their eye muscles (ocular myasthenia gravis) have this antibody in their blood. This antibody can also be present in the blood of people who have a thymoma, with or without myasthenia gravis. However, the lack of this antibody does not rule out myasthenia gravis. About 1 in 5 people with myasthenia gravis do not have signs of this antibody in their blood. Your health care provider may also consider testing you for the muscle specific kinase (MuSK) or other antibodies.

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the arm is an imaging method that uses x-rays to make cross-sectional pictures of the arm. How the Test is Performed You will be asked to lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the CT scanner. Once you are inside the scanner, the machine's x-ray beam rotates around you. Modern "spiral" scanners can perform the exam without stopping. A computer creates separate images of the arm area, called slices. These images can be stored, viewed on a monitor, or printed on film. Three-dimensional models of the arm can be created by adding the slices together. You must be still during the exam. Movement can cause blurred images. You may be told to hold your breath for short periods of time. The scan should take only 10 to 15 minutes. How to Prepare for the Test For some tests, you will need to have a special dye, called contrast, to be delivered into the body before the test starts. Contrast helps certain areas show up better on the x-rays. Contrast can be given through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. If contrast is used, you may also be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test. Let your health care provider know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast. You may need to take medicines before the test in order to safely receive contrast. Before receiving the contrast, tell your provider if you take the diabetes drug metformin (Glucophage). You may need to take special steps if you are on this medicine. If you weigh more than 300 pounds (135 kilograms), find out if the CT machine has a weight limit. Too much weight can cause damage to the scanner's working parts. You will be asked to remove jewelry and wear a hospital gown during the study as metal can affect the CT images. How the Test will Feel Some people may have discomfort from lying on the hard table. Contrast given through an IV may cause a slight burning sensation, a metallic taste in the mouth, and a warm flushing of the body. These feelings are normal. They will go away within a few seconds. Why the Test is Performed CT rapidly creates detailed pictures of the body, including the arms. The test may help detect or diagnose: An abscess or infection The cause of pain or other problems in the wrist, shoulder or elbow joints (usually when MRI cannot be done) A broken bone Masses and tumors, including cancer Healing problems or scar tissue following surgery A deformity so the provider can plan appropriate treatment A CT scan may also be used to guide a surgeon to the right area during a biopsy . Normal Results Results are considered normal if no problems are seen in the images. What Abnormal Results Mean Abnormal results may be due to: Degenerative changes due to age Abscess (collection of pus) Blood clot in the arm (deep venous thrombosis) Bone tumors Cancer Broken or fractured bone Damage to the hand, wrist, or elbow joints Cyst Healing problems or development of scar tissue after surgery Deformity from growth Risks Risks of CT scans include: Being exposed to radiation Allergic reaction to contrast dye Birth defect if done during pregnancy CT scans expose you to more radiation than regular x-rays. Having many x-rays or CT scans over time may increase your risk for cancer. However, the risk from any one scan is small. You and your provider should weigh this risk against the benefits of getting a correct diagnosis for a medical problem. Some people have allergies to contrast dye. Let your provider know if you have ever had an allergic reaction to injected contrast dye. The most common type of contrast given into a vein contains iodine. A person with an iodine allergy may have nausea or vomiting, sneezing, itching, or hives if given this type of contrast. If contrast is needed, you may get antihistamines (such as Benadryl) or steroids before the test. The kidneys help remove iodine out of the body. Those with kidney disease or diabetes may need to get extra fluids after the test to help flush the iodine out of the body. Rarely, the dye may cause a life-threatening allergic response called anaphylaxis. If you have any trouble breathing during the test, let the scanner operator know right away. Scanners have intercom and speakers so the operator can hear you at all times.

Aortic angiography is a procedure that uses a special dye and x-rays to see how blood flows through the aorta. The aorta is the major artery. It carries blood out of the heart, and through your abdomen or belly. Angiography uses x-rays and a special dye to see the insides of the arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart. How the Test is Performed This test is done at a hospital. Before the test starts, you will be given a mild sedative to help you relax. An area of your body, most often in your arm or groin area, is cleaned and numbed with a local numbing medicine (anesthetic). A radiologist or cardiologist will place a needle into the groin blood vessel. A guidewire and a long tube (catheter) will be passed through this needle. The catheter is moved into the aorta. The doctor can see live images of the aorta on a TV-like monitor. X-rays are used to guide the catheter to the correct position. Once the catheter is in place, dye is injected into it. X-ray images are taken to see how the dye moves through the aorta. The dye helps detect any blockages in blood flow. After the x-rays or treatments are finished, the catheter is removed. Pressure is applied to the puncture site for 20 to 45 minutes to stop the bleeding. After that time, the area is checked and a tight bandage is applied. The leg is most often kept straight for another 6 hours after the procedure. You should avoid strenuous activity, such as heavy lifting, for 24 to 48 hours. How to Prepare for the Test You may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 6 to 8 hours before the test. You will wear a hospital gown and sign a consent form for the procedure. Remove jewelry from the area being studied. Tell your health care provider: If you are pregnant If you have ever had any allergic reactions to x-ray contrast material, shellfish, or iodine substances If you are allergic to any medicines Which medicines you are taking (including any herbal preparations) If you have ever had any bleeding problems You will be awake during the test. You may feel a sting as the numbing medicine is given and some pressure as the catheter is inserted. You may feel a warm flushing when the contrast dye flows through the catheter. This is normal and most often goes away in a few seconds. You may have some discomfort from lying on the hospital table and staying still for a long time. In most cases, you can resume normal activity the day after the procedure. Why the Test is Performed Your provider may ask for this test if there are signs or symptoms of a problem with the aorta or its branches, including: Aortic aneurysm Aortic dissection Congenital (present from birth) problems AV malformation Double aortic arch Coarctation of the aorta Vascular ring Injury to the aorta Takayasu arteritis What Abnormal Results Mean Abnormal results may be due to: Abdominal aortic aneurysm Aortic dissection Aortic regurgitation Congenital (present from birth) problems Double aortic arch Coarctation of the aorta Vascular ring Injury to the aorta Mesenteric artery disease or ischemia Peripheral artery disease Renal artery stenosis Takayasu arteritis Risks Risks of aortic angiography include: Allergic reaction to the contrast dye Blockage of the artery Blood clot that travels to the lungs Bruising at the site of catheter insertion Damage to the blood vessel where the needle and catheter are inserted Excessive bleeding or a blood clot where the catheter is inserted, which can reduce blood flow to the leg Heart attack or stroke Hematoma, a collection of blood at the site of the needle puncture Infection Injury to the nerves at the needle puncture site Kidney damage from the dye Considerations This procedure may be done with left heart catheterization to look for coronary artery disease. Aortic angiography has been mostly replaced by computed tomography (CT) angiography or magnetic resonance (MR) angiography .

The conjunctiva is a clear layer of tissue lining the eyelids and covering the white of the eye. Allergic conjunctivitis occurs when the conjunctiva becomes swollen or inflamed due to a reaction to pollen, dust mites, pet dander, mold, or other allergy-causing substances. Causes When your eyes are exposed to allergy-causing substances, a substance called histamine is released by your body. The blood vessels in the conjunctiva become swollen. The eyes can become red, itchy , and teary very quickly. The pollens that cause symptoms vary from person to person and from area to area. Tiny, hard-to-see pollens that may cause allergic symptoms include grasses, ragweed and trees. These same pollens may also cause hay fever. Your symptoms may be worse when there is more pollen in the air. Higher levels of pollen are more likely on hot, dry, windy days. On cool, damp, rainy days most pollen is washed to the ground. Mold, animal dander, or dust mites may cause this problem also. Allergies tend to run in families. It is hard to know exactly how many people have allergies. Many conditions are often lumped under the term "allergy" even when they might not truly be an allergy. Symptoms Symptoms may be seasonal and can include: Intense itching or burning eyes Puffy eyelids, most often in the morning Red eyes Stringy eye discharge Tearing (watery eyes) Widened blood vessels in the clear tissue covering the white of the eye Exams and Tests Your health care provider may look for the following: Small, raised bumps on the inside of the eyelids (papillary conjunctivitis) Positive skin test for suspected allergens on allergy tests Allergy testing may reveal the pollen or other substances that trigger your symptoms. Skin testing is the most common method of allergy testing. Skin testing is more likely to be done if symptoms do not respond to treatment. Treatment The best treatment is to avoid what causes your allergy symptoms as much as possible. Common triggers to avoid include dust, mold and pollen. Some things you can do to ease symptoms are: Use lubricating eye drops. Apply cool compresses to the eyes. Do not smoke and avoid secondhand smoke. Take over-the-counter oral antihistamines or antihistamine or decongestant eye drops. These medicines can offer more relief, but they can sometimes make your eyes dry. (Do not use the eye drops if you have contact lenses in place. Also, do not use the eye drops for more than 5 days, as rebound congestion can occur). If home-care does not help, you may need to see a provider for treatments such as eye drops that contain antihistamines or eye drops that reduce swelling. Mild eye steroid drops can be prescribed for more severe reactions. You may also use eye drops that prevent a type of white blood cell called mast cells from causing swelling. These drops are given along with antihistamines. These medicines work best if you take them before you come in contact with the allergen. Referral to an ophthalmologist before using steroid eye drops should be done since intraocular pressure measurements and a more thorough eye exam (using a slit lamp) is needed. Outlook (Prognosis) Symptoms often go away with treatment. However, they can persist if you continue to be exposed to the allergen. Long-term swelling of the outer lining of the eyes may occur in those with chronic allergies or asthma. It is called vernal conjunctivitis . It is most common in young males, and most often occurs during the spring and summer. Possible Complications There are no serious complications. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if: You have symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis that do not respond to self-care steps and over-the-counter treatment. Your vision is affected. You develop eye pain that is severe or becoming worse. Your eyelids or the skin around your eyes becomes swollen or red. You have a headache in addition to your other symptoms.

When you have radiation treatment for cancer, your body goes through changes. Follow your health care provider's instructions on how to care for yourself at home. Use the information below as a reminder. What to Expect at Home About 2 weeks after radiation treatment starts, you might notice changes in your skin. Most of these symptoms go away after your treatments have stopped. Your skin and mouth may turn red. Your skin might start to peel or get dark. Your skin may itch. Your body hair will fall out after about 2 weeks, but only in the area being treated. When your hair grows back, it may be different than before. Around the second or third week after radiation treatments start, you may have: Diarrhea Cramping in your belly An upset stomach Skin Care When you have radiation treatment, color markings are drawn on your skin. Do not remove them. These show where to aim the radiation. If they come off, do not redraw them. Tell your provider instead. To take care of the treatment area: Wash gently with lukewarm water only. Don't scrub. Use a mild soap that doesn't dry out your skin. Pat your skin dry. Don't use lotions, ointments, makeup, perfumed powders, or products on the treatment area. Ask your provider what you should use. Keep the area that is being treated out of the direct sun. Don't scratch or rub your skin. Don't put a heating pad or an ice bag on the treatment area. Tell your provider if you have any break or opening in your skin. Other Self-care Wear loose-fitting clothing around your stomach and pelvis. You will likely feel tired after a few weeks. If so: Don't try to do too much. You probably will not be able to do everything you used to. Try to get more sleep at night. Rest during the day when you can. Take a few weeks off work, or work less. Ask your provider before taking any medicines or other remedies for an upset stomach. Don't eat for 4 hours before your treatment. If your stomach feels upset just before your treatment: Try a bland snack, such as toast or crackers and apple juice. Try to relax. Read, listen to music, or do a crossword puzzle. If your stomach is upset right after radiation treatment: Wait 1 to 2 hours after your treatment before eating. Your provider may prescribe medicines to help. For an upset stomach: Stay on the special diet that your provider or dietitian recommends for you. Eat small meals and eat more often during the day. Eat and drink slowly. Don't eat foods that are fried or are high in fat. Drink cool liquids between meals. Eat foods that are cool or at room temperature, instead of warm or hot. Cooler foods will smell less. Choose foods with a mild odor. Try a clear, liquid diet -- water, weak tea, apple juice, peach nectar, clear broth, and plain Jell-O. Eat bland food, such as dry toast or Jell-O. To help with diarrhea: Try a clear, liquid diet. Don't eat raw fruits and vegetables and other high-fiber foods, coffee, beans, cabbage, whole grain breads and cereals, sweets, or spicy foods. Eat and drink slowly. Don't drink milk or eat any other dairy products if they bother your bowels. When the diarrhea starts to improve, eat small amounts of low-fiber foods, such as white rice, bananas, applesauce, mashed potatoes, low-fat cottage cheese, and dry toast. Eat foods that are high in potassium (bananas, potatoes, and apricots) when you have diarrhea. Eat enough protein and calories to keep your weight up. Follow-up Care Your provider may check your blood counts regularly, especially if the radiation treatment area is large.

Eating smaller amounts will help prevent swelling. For a swollen abdomen caused by swallowing air: Avoid carbonated beverages. Avoid chewing gum or sucking on candies. Avoid drinking through a straw or sipping the surface of a hot beverage. Eat slowly. For a swollen abdomen caused by malabsorption , try changing your diet and limiting milk. Talk to your health care provider. For irritable bowel syndrome: Decrease emotional stress . Increase dietary fiber . Talk to your provider. For a swollen abdomen due to other causes, follow the treatment prescribed by your provider.

Your abdomen is tender to the touch. You have a high fever. You have severe diarrhea or bloody stools. You are unable to eat or drink for more than 6 to 8 hours. What to Expect at Your Office Visit Your provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions about your medical history, such as when the problem began and when it occurs.

An antiparietal cell antibody test is a blood test that looks for antibodies against the parietal cells of the stomach. The parietal cells make and release a substance called intrinsic factor that the body needs to absorb vitamin B12. How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed. How to Prepare for the Test No special preparation is necessary. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed Your health care provider may use this test to help diagnose pernicious anemia . Pernicious anemia is a decrease in red blood cells that occurs when your intestines cannot properly absorb vitamin B12. Other tests are also used to help with the diagnosis. Normal Results A normal result is called a negative result. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean An abnormal result is called a positive result. This may be due to: Atrophic gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining) Diabetes Gastric ulcer Thyroid disease Risks There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Multiple punctures to locate veins Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names APCA; Anti-gastric parietal cell antibody; Atrophic gastritis - anti-gastric parietal cell antibody; Gastric ulcer - anti-gastric parietal cell antibody; Pernicious anemia - anti-gastric parietal cell antibody; Vitamin B12 - anti-gastric parietal cell antibody Images Antiparietal cell antibodies References Cooling LL, Downs T.

Falls can be a serious problem in the hospital. Factors that increase the risk of falls include: Poor lighting Slippery floors Equipment in rooms and hallways that gets in the way Being weak or confused from illness or surgery Being in new surroundings A history of falls Hospital staff often do not see patients fall. But falls require attention right away to lessen the risk of injury. When the Patient Falls If you are with a patient when they begin to fall: Use your body to break the fall. Protect your own back by keeping your feet wide apart and your knees bent. Make sure the patient's head does not hit the floor or any other surface. After the Fall Stay with the patient and call for help. Check the patient's breathing, pulse, and blood pressure. If the patient is unconscious, not breathing, or does not have a pulse, call a hospital emergency code and start CPR . Check for injury, such as cuts, scrapes, bruises, and broken bones. If you were not there when the patient fell, ask the patient or someone who saw the fall what happened. If the patient is confused, shaking, or shows signs of weakness, pain, or dizziness: Stay with the patient. Provide blankets for comfort until medical staff arrives. Do not raise the patient's head if they may have a neck or back injury. Wait for medical staff to check for a spinal injury. Once medical staff decides the patient can be moved, you need to choose the best way. If the patient is not hurt or injured and does not appear ill, have another staff member help you. Both of you should help the patient into a wheelchair or into bed. Do not help the patient on your own. If the patient cannot support most of their own body weight, you may need to use a backboard or a lift. Watch the patient closely after the fall. You may need to check the patient's alertness, blood pressure and pulse, and possibly blood sugar. Document the fall according to your hospital's policies.

In people who have sensitive airways, allergy and asthma symptoms can be triggered by breathing in substances called allergens , or triggers. It is important to know your triggers because avoiding them is your first step toward feeling better. Pollen is a common trigger. Pollens Pollen is a trigger for many people who have allergies and asthma. The types of pollens that are triggers vary from person to person and from region to region. Plants that may trigger hay fever (allergic rhinitis) and asthma include: Some trees Some grasses Weeds Ragweed Watch the Weather and the Season The amount of pollen in the air can affect whether you or your child has hay fever and asthma symptoms. On hot, dry, windy days, more pollen is in the air. On cool, rainy days, most pollen is washed to the ground. Different plants produce pollen at different times of the year. Most trees produce pollen in the spring. Grasses usually produce pollen during the late spring and summer. Ragweed and other late-blooming plants produce pollen during late summer and early fall. When Pollen Levels are High The weather report on TV or on the radio often has pollen count information. Or, you can look it up online. When pollen levels are high: Stay indoors and keep doors and windows closed. Use an air conditioner if you have one. Save outside activities for late afternoon or after a heavy rain. Avoid the outdoors between 5 a.m. and 10 a.m. Do not dry clothes outdoors. Pollen will stick to them. Have someone who does not have asthma cut the grass. Or, wear a face mask if you must do it. Keep grass cut short or replace your grass with a ground cover. Choose a ground cover that does not produce much pollen, such as Irish moss, bunch grass, or dichondra.

How should I treat my chest pain, or angina, when it happens? When should I call my provider? When should I call 911 or the local emergency number? How much exercise or activity can I do? Do I need to have a stress test first? Is it safe for me to exercise on my own? Where should I exercise, inside or outside? Which activities are better to start with? Are there activities or exercises that are not safe for me? How long and how hard can I exercise? When can I return to work? Are there limits to what I can do at work? What should I do if I feel sad or very worried about my heart disease? How can I change the way I live to make my heart stronger? What is a heart-healthy diet? Is it OK to ever eat something that is not heart healthy? What are some ways to eat healthy when I go to a restaurant? Is it OK to drink any alcohol? Is it OK to be around other people who are smoking? Is my blood pressure normal? What is my cholesterol and do I need to take medicines for it? Is it OK to be sexually active? Is it safe to use sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), or tadalafil (Cialis)? What medicines am I taking to treat or prevent angina? Do they have any side effects? What should I do if I miss a dose? Is it ever safe to stop any of these medicines on my own? If I am taking aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), ticagrelor (Brilinta), prasugrel (Effient), or another blood thinner, is it OK to take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or other pain medicines?

Acetone is a chemical used in many household products. This article discusses poisoning from swallowing acetone-based products. Poisoning may also occur from breathing in fumes or absorbing it through the skin. This is for information only and not for use in the treatment or management of an actual poison exposure. If you have an exposure, you should call your local emergency number (such as 911) or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. Poisonous Ingredient The poisonous ingredients include: Acetone Dimethyl formaldehyde Dimethyl ketone Where Found Acetone can be found in: Nail polish remover Some cleaning solutions Some glues, including rubber cement Some lacquers Other products may also contain acetone. Symptoms Below are symptoms of acetone poisoning or exposure in different parts of the body. HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS (CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM) Low blood pressure STOMACH AND INTESTINES (GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM) Nausea and vomiting Pain in belly area Person may have a fruity odor Sweet taste in mouth NERVOUS SYSTEM Feeling of drunkenness Coma (unconscious, unresponsive) Drowsiness Stupor (confusion, decreased level of consciousness) Lack of coordination BREATHING (RESPIRATORY)
SYSTEM Difficulty breathing Slowed breathing rate Shortness of breath URINARY SYSTEM Increased need to urinate Home Care Seek medical help right away. Do NOT make a person throw up unless the poison control center or a health care provider tells you to. Before Calling Emergency Have this information ready: The person's age, weight, and condition The name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known) The time it was swallowed The amount swallowed Poison Control Your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. This is a free and confidential service. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. What to Expect at the Emergency Room Take the container that contains the acetone with you to the hospital, if possible. The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated. The person may receive: Blood tests Breathing support, including oxygen and a breathing tube through the mouth into the lungs Chest x-ray ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing) Intravenous fluids (IV, fluids given through a vein) Medicines to treat symptoms Tube through the nose into the stomach to empty the stomach ( gastric lavage ) Outlook (Prognosis) Accidentally drinking small amounts of acetone/nail polish remover is unlikely to harm you as an adult. However, even small amounts can be dangerous to your child, so it is important to keep this and all household chemicals in a safe place. If the person survives past 48 hours, the chances for recovery are good.

Arterial insufficiency is any condition that slows or stops the flow of blood through your arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to other places in your body. Causes One of the most common causes of arterial insufficiency is atherosclerosis or "hardening of the arteries." Fatty material (called plaque) builds up on the walls of your arteries. This causes them to become narrow and stiff. As a result, it is hard for blood to flow through your arteries. Blood flow may be suddenly stopped due to a blood clot . Clots can form on the plaque or less often travel from another place such as the heart or other artery (also called embolus). Symptoms Symptoms depend on where your arteries become narrowed: If it affects your heart arteries, you may have chest pain (angina pectoris) or a heart attack . If it affects your brain arteries, you may have a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke . If it affects the arteries that bring blood to your legs, you may have frequent leg cramping when you walk called claudication. If it affects the arteries in your belly area, you may have pain after you eat called abdominal angina (due to mesenteric ischemia).

Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and codeine is a prescription pain medicine. It is an opioid pain reliever used only for pain that is severe and is not helped by other types of painkillers. Acetaminophen and codeine overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine, either by accident or on purpose. This article is for information only. Do not use it to treat or manage an actual overdose . If you or someone you are with overdoses, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. Poisonous Ingredient Acetaminophen combined with codeine Where Found Acetaminophen with codeine is commonly sold under the name Tylenol #3. Symptoms Below are symptoms of an overdose of acetaminophen combined with codeine in different parts of the body. AIRWAYS AND LUNGS Shallow breathing Slow and labored breathing Stopped breathing EYES Very small pupils HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS Low blood pressure NERVOUS SYSTEM Coma (lack of responsiveness) Convulsions ( seizures ) Drowsiness Stupor (lack of alertness) SKIN Bluish skin (fingernails and lips) Cold, clammy skin Heavy sweating STOMACH AND GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM Nausea and vomiting Spasms of the stomach and intestines Liver failure URINARY SYSTEM Kidney failure Home Care Seek medical help right away. This type of overdose can cause death. Do not make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to. Before Calling Emergency Have this information ready: The person's age, weight, and condition Name of the medicine and the strength of the medicine (if known) Time it was swallowed Amount swallowed If the medicine was prescribed for the person Poison Control Your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. What to Expect at the Emergency Room Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible. Your provider will measure and monitor your vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated. You may be admitted to the hospital. Tests that may be done include: Blood and urine tests Chest x-ray CT scan (advanced imaging) of the brain Electrocardiogram (ECG) Treatment may include: Activated charcoal Breathing support, including oxygen, tube through the mouth into the lungs, and breathing machine (ventilator) Fluids through a vein (IV) Laxative Medicine to reverse the effects of the overdose and treat symptoms. If there is a high level of acetaminophen in the blood, the person will be given N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) as soon as possible. This medicine is called an antidote. It counteracts the effects of the acetaminophen. Without it, deadly liver failure may occur. Several doses may be required until the blood level drops to a safer value. If there are signs of a severe opioid overdose, the antidote naloxone will be given. Outlook (Prognosis) How well a person does, depends on the amount of medicine swallowed and how quickly the treatment was received. The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery. If breathing has been depressed for a long period before treatment, brain injury may occur. If an antidote can be given, recovery from an acute overdose often occurs within 24 to 48 hours. Recovery takes longer, if the liver is affected, and the person may not fully recover.

Abnormally dark or light skin is skin that has turned darker or lighter than normal. Considerations Normal skin contains cells called melanocytes. These cells produce melanin , the substance that gives skin its color. Skin with too much melanin is called hyperpigmented skin. Skin with too little melanin is called hypopigmented. Skin with no melanin at all is called depigmented. Pale skin areas are due to too little melanin or underactive melanocytes. Darker areas of skin (or an area that tans more easily) occurs when you have more melanin or overactive melanocytes. Bronzing of the skin may sometimes be mistaken for a suntan. This skin discoloration often develops slowly, starting at the elbows, knuckles, and knees and spreading from there. Bronzing may also be seen on the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands. The bronze color can range from light to dark (in fair-skinned people) with the degree of darkness due to the underlying cause. Causes Causes of hyperpigmentation include: Skin inflammation (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation) Use of certain drugs (such as minocycline, certain cancer chemotherapies, and birth control pills) Hormone system diseases such as Addison disease Hemochromatosis (iron overload) Sun exposure Pregnancy (melasma, or mask of pregnancy) Certain birthmarks Skin condition called acanthosis nigricans Causes of hypopigmentation include: Skin inflammation (post-inflammatory hypopigmentation) Certain fungal infections (such as tinea versicolor ) Pityriasis alba Vitiligo Certain medicines Skin condition called idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis in sun exposed areas such as the arms Certain birthmarks Home Care Over-the-counter and prescription creams are available for lightening the skin. Hydroquinone combined with tretinoin is an effective combination. If you use these creams, follow instructions carefully, and don't use one for more than 3 weeks at a time. Darker skin requires greater care when using these preparations. Cosmetics may also help mask a discoloration. Avoid too much sun exposure. Always use sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. Abnormally dark skin may continue even after treatment. When to Contact a Medical Professional Call your health care provider for an appointment if you have: Skin discoloration that causes significant concern Persistent, unexplained darkening or lightening of the skin Any skin sore or lesion that changes shape, size, or color may be a sign of skin cancer What to Expect at Your Office Visit Your provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms, including: When did the discoloration develop? Did it develop suddenly? Is it getting worse? How fast? Has it spread to other parts of the body? What medicines do you take? Has anyone else in your family had a similar problem? How often are you in the sun? Do you use a sun lamp or go to tanning salons? What is your diet like? What other symptoms do you have? For example, are there any rashes or skin lesions ? Tests that may be done include: Adrenocorticotrophin hormone stimulation test Skin biopsy Thyroid function studies Wood lamp test KOH test Your provider may recommend creams, ointments, surgery, or phototherapy, depending on the type of skin condition you have. Bleaching creams can help lighten dark areas of skin. Some skin color changes may return to normal without treatment.

Choking is when someone is having a very hard time breathing because food, a toy, or other object is blocking the throat or windpipe (airway). A choking person's airway may be blocked so that not enough oxygen reaches the lungs. Without oxygen, brain damage can occur in as little as 4 to 6 minutes. Rapid first aid for choking can save a person's life. Abdominal thrusts is an emergency technique to help clear someone's airway. The procedure is done on someone who is choking and also conscious . Most experts do not recommend abdominal thrusts for infants less than 1 year old. You can also perform the maneuver on yourself . First Aid First ask, "Are you choking? Can you speak?" DO NOT perform first aid if the person is coughing forcefully and is able to speak. A strong cough can often dislodge the object. If the person is choking, perform abdominal thrusts as follows: If the person is sitting or standing, position yourself behind the person and reach your arms around their waist. For a child, you may have to kneel. Place your fist, thumb side in, just above the person's navel (belly button). Grasp the fist tightly with your other hand. Make quick, upward and inward thrusts with your fist. If the person is lying on their back, straddle the person facing the head. Push your grasped fist upward and inward in a movement similar to the one above. You may need to repeat the procedure several times before the object is dislodged. If repeated attempts do not free the airway, call 911 or the local emergency number. If the person loses consciousness, start CPR . If you are not comfortable performing abdominal thrusts, you can perform back blows instead on a person who is choking.

Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a kidney disorder involving damage to the tubule cells of the kidneys, which can lead to acute kidney failure . The tubules are tiny ducts in the kidneys that help filter the blood when it passes through the kidneys. Causes ATN is often caused by a lack of blood flow and oxygen to the kidney tissues (ischemia of the kidneys). It may also occur if the kidney cells are damaged by a poison or harmful substance. The internal structures of the kidney, particularly the tissues of the kidney tubule, become damaged or destroyed. ATN is one of the most common structural changes that can lead to acute kidney failure. ATN is a common cause of kidney failure in people who are in the hospital. Risks for ATN include: Blood transfusion reaction Injury or trauma that damages the muscles Low blood pressure (hypotension) that lasts longer than 30 minutes Recent major surgery Septic shock (serious condition that occurs when a body-wide infection leads to dangerously low blood pressure) Liver disease and kidney damage caused by diabetes ( diabetic nephropathy ) may make a person more prone to develop ATN. ATN can also be caused by medicines that are toxic to the kidneys. These medicines include aminoglycoside antibiotics and the antifungal drug amphotericin. Symptoms Symptoms may include any of the following: Decreased consciousness , coma, delirium or confusion , drowsiness, and lethargy Decreased urine output or no urine output General swelling, fluid retention Nausea, vomiting Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. Your provider may hear abnormal sounds when listening to the heart and lungs with a stethoscope. This is due to too much fluid in the body. Tests that may be done include: Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine Fractional excretion of sodium Kidney biopsy Urinalysis Urine sodium Urine specific gravity and urine osmolarity Treatment In most people, ATN is reversible. The goal of treatment is to prevent life-threatening complications of acute kidney failure Treatment focuses on preventing the buildup of fluids and wastes, while allowing the kidneys to heal. Treatment may include any of the following: Identifying and treating the underlying cause of the problem Restricting fluid intake Taking medicines to help control the potassium level in the blood Medicines taken by mouth or through an IV to help remove fluid from the body Temporary dialysis can remove excess waste and fluids. This can help improve your symptoms so that you feel better. It may also make kidney failure easier to control. Dialysis may not be necessary for all people, but is often lifesaving, especially if potassium is dangerously high. Dialysis may be needed in the following cases: Decreased mental status Fluid overload Increased potassium level Pericarditis (inflammation of the sac-like covering around the heart) Removal of toxins that are dangerous to the kidneys Total lack of urine production Uncontrolled buildup of nitrogen waste products Outlook (Prognosis) ATN can last for a few days to 6 weeks or more. This may be followed by 1 or 2 days of making an unusually large amount of urine as the kidneys recover. Kidney function often returns to normal, but there may be other serious problems and complications. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider if your urine output decreases or stops, or if you develop other symptoms of ATN. Prevention Promptly treating conditions that can lead to decreased blood flow as well as decreased oxygen to the kidneys can reduce the risk for ATN. Blood transfusions are crossmatched to reduce the risk of incompatibility reactions. Diabetes, liver disorders, and heart problems need to be managed well to reduce the risk for ATN. If you know you're taking medicine that can injure your kidneys, ask your provider about having your blood level of the medicine checked regularly. Drink a lot of fluids after having any contrast dyes to allow them to be removed from the body and reduce the risk for kidney damage.

A1C is a lab test that shows the average level of blood sugar (glucose) over the previous 3 months. It shows how well you are controlling your blood sugar to help prevent complications from diabetes. How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed. Two methods are available: Blood drawn from a vein. This is done at a lab. Finger stick. This can be done in your health care provider's office. Or, you may be prescribed a kit that you can use at home. Results by finger stick may differ slightly from blood drawn from a vein, but in most cases can also be used to monitor your treatment. How to Prepare for the Test No special preparation is needed. The food you have recently eaten does not affect the A1C test, so you do not need to fast to prepare for this blood test. How the Test will Feel With a finger stick, you may feel slight pain. With blood drawn from a vein, you may feel a slight pinch or some stinging when the needle is inserted. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed Your provider may order this test if you have diabetes . It shows how well you are controlling your diabetes. The test may also be used to screen for diabetes. Ask your provider how often you should have your A1C level tested. Usually, testing every 3 or 6 months is recommended. Normal Results The following are the results when A1C is being used to diagnose diabetes: Normal (no diabetes): Less than 5.7% Pre-diabetes: 5.7% to 6.4% Diabetes: 6.5% or higher If you have diabetes, you and your provider will discuss the correct range for you. For many people, the goal is to keep the level below 7%. The test result may be incorrect in people with anemia , kidney disease, liver disease, or certain blood disorders ( thalassemia ). Talk to your provider if you have any of these conditions. Certain medicines can also result in a false A1C level. The examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean An abnormal result means that you have had a high blood sugar level over a period of weeks to months. If your A1C is 6.5% or higher and you do not already have diabetes, you may be diagnosed with diabetes. If your level is above 7% and you have diabetes, it often means that your blood sugar is not as well controlled as would be ideal. You and your provider should determine your target A1C. Many labs now use the A1C to calculate an estimated average glucose (eAG) . This estimate may be different from the average blood sugars you are recording from your glucose meter or continuous glucose monitor. Talk to your provider about what this means. The actual blood sugar readings are usually more reliable than the estimated average glucose based on the A1C. The higher your A1C, the higher the risk that you will develop problems such as: Eye disease Heart disease Kidney disease Nerve damage Stroke If your A1C stays high, talk to your provider about how to best manage your blood sugar . Risks There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks of having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Multiple punctures to locate veins Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names HbA1C test; Glycated hemoglobin test; Glycohemoglobin test; Hemoglobin A1C; Diabetes - A1C; Diabetic - A1C Patient Instructions Diabetes tests and checkups Images Blood test References American Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee; Drazin B, Aroda VR, et al. 6.

Aging changes in the female reproductive system result mainly from changing hormone levels . One clear sign of aging occurs when your menstrual periods stop permanently. This is known as menopause . The time before menopause is called perimenopause. It may begin several years before your last menstrual period. Signs of perimenopause include: More frequent periods at first, and then occasional missed periods Periods that are longer or shorter Changes in the amount of menstrual flow Eventually your periods will become much less frequent, until they stop completely. Along with changes in your periods, physical changes in your reproductive tract occur as well. AGING CHANGES AND THEIR EFFECTS Menopause is a normal part of a woman's aging process. Most women experience menopause around age 50, though it can occur before that age. The usual age range is 45 to 55. With menopause: The ovaries stop making the hormones estrogen and progesterone. The ovaries also stop releasing eggs (ova, oocytes). After menopause, you can no longer become pregnant. Your menstrual periods stop. You know you have gone through menopause after you have had no periods for 1 year. You should continue to use a birth control method until you have gone a whole year without a period. Any bleeding that occurs more than 1 year after your last period is not normal and should be checked by your health care provider. As hormone levels fall, other changes occur in the reproductive system, including: Vaginal walls become thinner, dryer, less elastic, and possibly irritated. Sometimes sex becomes painful due to these vaginal changes. Your risk for vaginal yeast infections increases. The external genital tissue decreases and thins, and can become irritated. Other common changes include: Menopause symptoms such as hot flashes, moodiness, headaches, and trouble sleeping, which can persist for years Problems with short-term memory Decrease in breast tissue Lower sex drive (libido) and sexual response Increased risk for bone loss ( osteoporosis ) Urinary system changes, such as frequency and urgency of urination and increased risk for urinary tract infection Loss of tone in the pubic muscles, resulting in the vagina, uterus , or urinary bladder falling out of position (prolapse) MANAGING CHANGES Hormone therapy with estrogen or progesterone, alone or in combination, may help menopause symptoms such as hot flashes or vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse. Most women who have a uterus will require progesterone as well as estrogen. Women without a uterus may take estrogen only. Hormone therapy has risks, so it is not for every woman. Discuss the risks and benefits of hormone therapy with your provider. To help manage problems such as painful sexual intercourse, use a lubricant during sexual intercourse. Vaginal moisturizers are available without a prescription. These can help with vaginal and vulvar discomfort due to the drying and thinning of tissues. Applying topical estrogen inside the vagina may help thicken the vaginal tissues and increase moisture and sensitivity. Your provider can tell you if any of these measures is right for you. Getting regular exercise, eating healthy foods, and staying involved in activities with friends and loved ones can help the aging process go more smoothly.

An arterial stick is the collection of blood from an artery for laboratory testing. How the Test Is Performed Blood is usually drawn from an artery in the wrist. It may also be drawn from an artery on the inside of the elbow, groin, or other site. If blood is drawn from the wrist, the health care provider will first check the pulse. This is to make sure blood is flowing into the hand from the main arteries in the forearm (radial and ulnar arteries). The procedure is done as follows: The area is cleaned with antiseptic. A needle is inserted. A small amount of anesthetic may be injected or applied before the needle is inserted. Blood flows into a special collecting syringe. The needle is removed after enough blood is collected. Pressure is applied to the puncture site for 5 to 10 minutes to stop the bleeding. The site will be checked during this time to make sure the bleeding stops. If it is easier to get blood from one location or side of your body, let the person who is drawing your blood know it before starting the test. How to Prepare for the Test Preparation varies with the specific test performed. How the Test will Feel Puncture of an artery may be more uncomfortable than puncture of a vein. This is because arteries are deeper than veins. Arteries also have thicker walls and have more nerves. When the needle is inserted, there may be some discomfort or pain. Afterward, there may be some throbbing. Why the Test Is Performed Blood transports oxygen, nutrients, waste products, and other materials within the body. Blood also helps control body temperature, fluids, and the balance of chemicals. Blood is made up of a fluid portion (plasma) and a cellular portion. Plasma contains substances dissolved in the fluid. The cellular portion is made up mainly of red blood cells, but it also includes white blood cells and platelets . Because blood has many functions, tests on the blood or its components may give valuable clues to help providers diagnose many medical conditions. Blood in the arteries (arterial blood) differs from blood in the veins (venous blood) mainly in its content of dissolved gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide). Testing arterial blood shows the makeup of the blood before any of its contents are used by the body tissues. Normal Results Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean An arterial stick is done to get blood samples from arteries. Blood samples are mainly taken to measure gases dissolved in the arterial blood. Abnormal results may point to breathing problems or problems with the body's metabolism . Sometimes arterial sticks are done to get blood culture (testing for infection) or blood chemistry samples. Risks There is little risk in having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Multiple punctures to locate veins Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) There is a slight risk for damage to nearby tissues when the blood is drawn. Blood can be taken from lower-risk sites, and techniques can be used to limit tissue damage. Alternative Names Blood sample - arterial Images Arterial blood sample References Eiting E, Kim HT.

An abdominal x-ray is an imaging test to look at organs and structures in the abdomen. Organs include the liver, spleen, stomach, and intestines. When the test is done to look at the bladder and kidney structures, it is called a KUB (kidneys, ureters, bladder) x-ray. How the Test is Performed The test may be done in a hospital radiology department. Or, it may be done in the health care provider's office by an x-ray technologist. You lie on your back on the x-ray table. The x-ray machine is positioned over your abdominal area. You hold your breath as the picture is taken so that the picture will not be blurry. You may be asked to change position to the side or to stand up for additional pictures. Body parts not being imaged may be covered with a lead apron or shield to limit exposure to the x-rays. How to Prepare for the Test Before having the x-ray, tell your provider the following: If you are pregnant or think you could be pregnant Have had a barium contrast x-ray in the last 4 days You will wear a hospital gown during the x-ray procedure. You must remove all jewelry. How the Test will Feel There is no discomfort. The x-rays are taken as you lie on your back, side, and while standing. Why the Test is Performed Your provider may order this test to: Diagnose a pain in the abdomen or unexplained nausea Identify suspected problems in the urinary system, such as a kidney stone Identify blockage in the intestine Locate an object that has been swallowed Help diagnose diseases, such as tumors or other conditions Normal Results The x-ray will show normal structures for a person your age. What Abnormal Results Mean Abnormal findings include: Abdominal masses Buildup of fluid in the abdomen (ascites) Certain types of gallstones Foreign object in the intestines Hole in the stomach or intestines Intestinal blockage Kidney stones Risks There is low radiation exposure. X-rays are monitored and regulated to provide the minimum amount of radiation exposure needed to produce the image. Most experts feel that the risk is low compared to the benefits. Pregnant women and children are more sensitive to the risks of the x-ray. Women should tell their provider if they are, or may be, pregnant.

The ACTH stimulation test measures how well the adrenal glands respond to adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ). ACTH is a hormone produced in the pituitary gland that stimulates the adrenal glands to release a hormone called cortisol. How the Test is Performed The test is done the following way: Your blood is drawn. You then receive a shot (injection) of ACTH, usually into the muscle in your shoulder. The ACTH may be a man-made (synthetic) form. After either 30 minutes or 60 minutes, or both, depending on how much ACTH you receive, your blood is drawn again. The lab checks the cortisol level in all the blood samples. You may also have other blood tests, including ACTH , as part of the first blood test. Along with the blood tests, you may also have a urine cortisol test or urine 17-ketosteroids test , which involves collecting the urine over a 24-hour period . Sometimes the test is done to measure a different hormone called 17-hydroxy progesterone. How to Prepare for the Test You may need to limit activities and eat foods that are high in carbohydrates 12 to 24 hours before the test. You may be asked to fast for 6 hours before the test. Sometimes, no special preparation is needed. You may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines, such as hydrocortisone, which can interfere with the cortisol blood test. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away. The injection into the shoulder may cause moderate pain or stinging. Some people feel flushed, nervous, or nauseated after the injection of ACTH. Why the Test is Performed This test can help determine whether your adrenal and pituitary glands are normal. It is most often used when your health care provider thinks you have an adrenal gland problem, such as Addison disease , or pituitary insufficiency . It is also used to see if your pituitary and adrenal glands have recovered from prolonged use of glucocorticoid medicines, such as prednisone or dexamethasone. Normal Results An increase in cortisol after stimulation by ACTH is expected. Cortisol level after ACTH stimulation should be higher than 13 to 14 mcg/dL (358 to 386 nmol/L) depending on the type of cortisol assay used and, on the dose of ACTH used. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean This test is helpful in finding out if you have: Acute adrenal crisis (life-threatening condition that occurs when there is not enough cortisol) Addison disease (adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol) Hypopituitarism (pituitary gland is not producing enough hormones such as ACTH) Risks There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Multiple punctures to locate veins Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names Test of adrenal reserve; Cosyntropin stimulation test; Cortrosyn stimulation test; Synacthen stimulation test; Tetracosactide stimulation test References Newell-Price JDC, Auchus RJ.

Amino acids are molecules that combine to form proteins . Amino acids and proteins are the building blocks of life. When proteins are digested or broken down, amino acids are the result. The human body then uses amino acids to make proteins to help the body: Break down food Grow Repair body tissue Perform many other body functions Amino acids can also be used as a source of energy by the body. Amino acids are classified into three groups: Essential amino acids Nonessential amino acids Conditionally essential amino acids ESSENTIAL AMINO ACIDS Essential amino acids cannot be made by the body. As a result, they must come from food. The 9 essential amino acids are: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan , and valine. NONESSENTIAL AMINO ACIDS Nonessential means that our bodies can produce the amino acid, even if we do not get it from the food we eat. Nonessential amino acids include: alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, and tyrosine. CONDITIONALLY ESSENTIAL AMINO ACIDS Conditionally essential amino acids are usually not essential, except in times of illness and stress. Conditionally essential amino acids include: arginine, cysteine, glutamine, tyrosine, glycine, proline, and serine. You do not need to eat essential and nonessential amino acids at every meal, but getting a balance of them over the whole day is important. A diet based on a single plant item will not be adequate, but we no longer worry about pairing proteins (such as beans with rice) at a single meal. Instead we look at the adequacy of the diet overall throughout the day. Images Amino acids References Binder HJ, Mansbach CM. Nutrient digestion and absorption. In: Boron WF, Boulpaep EL, eds.

A decreased appetite is when your desire to eat is reduced. The medical term for a loss of appetite is anorexia. Considerations Any illness can reduce appetite. If the illness is treatable, the appetite should return when the condition is cured. Loss of appetite can cause weight loss . Causes A decreased appetite is often seen in older adults. Often, no physical cause is found. Emotions such as sadness, depression, or grief can lead to a loss of appetite. Cancer can also cause decreased appetite. You may lose weight without trying. Cancers that may cause you to lose your appetite include: Colon cancer Ovarian cancer Stomach cancer Pancreatic cancer Other causes of decreased appetite include: Chronic liver disease Chronic kidney disease Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Dementia Heart failure Hepatitis HIV Underactive thyroid ( hypothyroidism ) Pregnancy (first trimester) Use of certain medicines, including antibiotics, chemotherapy drugs, codeine, and morphine Use of street drugs, including amphetamines (speed), cocaine, and heroin Home Care People with cancer or a chronic illness that causes weight loss need to increase their protein and calorie intake by eating high-calorie, nutritious snacks or several small meals during the day. Liquid protein drinks may be helpful. Family members should try to supply favorite foods to help stimulate the person's appetite. Keep a record of what you eat and drink for 24 or more hours. This is called a diet history. When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your health care provider if you lose more than 10 pounds (4.5 kg) without trying. Seek medical help if decreased appetite occurs along with other signs of depression, drug or alcohol use, or an eating disorder. For loss of appetite caused by medicines, ask your provider about changing the dosage or medicine. Do not stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider. What to Expect at Your Office Visit The provider will perform a physical exam and will check your height and weight. You'll be asked about diet and medical history. Questions may include: Is the decreased appetite severe or mild? Have you lost any weight? How much? Is the decreased appetite a new symptom? If so, did it start after an upsetting event, such as the death of a family member or friend? What other symptoms are present? Tests that may be done include imaging tests, such as x-ray or ultrasound. Blood and urine tests may also be ordered. In cases of severe malnutrition, nutrients are given through a vein (intravenously). This may require a hospital stay.

An anorectal abscess is a collection of pus in the area of the anus and rectum. Causes Common causes of anorectal abscess include: Blocked glands in the anal area Infection of an anal fissure Sexually transmitted infection (STD) Trauma Deep rectal abscesses may be caused by intestinal disorders such as Crohn disease or diverticulitis . The following factors increase the risk for an anorectal abscess: Anal sex Chemotherapy medicines used to treat cancer Diabetes Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis ) Use of corticosteroid medicines Weakened immune system (such as from HIV/AIDS ) The condition affects men more than women. The condition may occur in infants and toddlers who are still in diapers and who have a history of anal fissures. Symptoms Common symptoms are swelling around the anus and a constant, throbbing pain with swelling. Pain may be severe with bowel movements, coughing and sitting. Other symptoms may include: Constipation Discharge of pus from the rectum Fatigue, fever , night sweats, and chills Redness, painful and hardened tissue in the area of the anus Tenderness In infants, the abscess often appears as a swollen, red, tender lump at the edge of the anus. The infant may be fussy and irritable from discomfort. There are usually no other symptoms. Exams and Tests A rectal examination may confirm an anorectal abscess. A proctosigmoidoscopy may be done to rule out other diseases. In some cases, a CT scan , MRI , or ultrasound is needed to help locate the collection of pus. Treatment The problem rarely goes away on its own. Antibiotics alone usually cannot treat an abscess. Treatment involves surgery to open and drain the abscess. Surgery is usually done with local numbing medicine, along with medicine to make you sleepy . Sometimes, spinal or general anesthesia is used. Surgery is most often an outpatient procedure, which means that you go home on the same day. The surgeon cuts open the abscess and drains the pus. Sometimes a drain is put in to keep the incision open and draining, and sometimes the abscess cavity is packed with gauze. If the pus collection is deep, you may need to stay in the hospital longer for pain control and nursing care of the abscess drainage site. After surgery, you may need warm sitz baths (sitting in a tub of warm water). This helps relieve pain and reduce swelling. Drained abscesses are usually left open and no stitches are needed. The surgeon may prescribe painkillers and antibiotics. Avoiding constipation will help decrease pain. You may need stool softeners. Drinking fluids and eating foods with lots of fiber can also help. Outlook (Prognosis) With prompt treatment, people with this condition usually do well. Infants and toddlers usually recover quickly. Complications can occur when treatment is delayed. Possible Complications Complications of anorectal abscess may include: Anal fistula (abnormal connection between the anus and another structure) Infection that spreads to the blood ( sepsis ) Continuing pain Problem keeps coming back (recurrence) When to Contact a Medical Professional Call your health care provider if you: Notice rectal discharge, pain, or other symptoms of anorectal abscess Have fever, chills, or other new symptoms after being treated for this condition Are a diabetic and your blood glucose becomes difficult to control Prevention Prevention or prompt treatment of STDs may prevent an anorectal abscess from forming. Use condoms during intercourse, including anal sex, to prevent such infections. In infants and toddlers, frequent diaper changes and proper cleaning during diaper changes can help prevent both anal fissures and abscesses.

Axillary nerve dysfunction is nerve damage that can lead to a loss of movement or sensation in the shoulder. Causes Axillary nerve dysfunction is a form of peripheral neuropathy . It occurs when there is damage to the axillary nerve. This is the nerve that helps control the deltoid muscles of the shoulder and the skin around it. A problem with just one nerve, such as the axillary nerve, is called mononeuropathy . The usual causes are: Direct injury Long-term pressure on the nerve Pressure on the nerve from nearby body structures (entrapment) Shoulder injury Entrapment creates pressure on the nerve where it passes through a narrow structure. The damage can destroy the myelin sheath that covers the nerve or part of the nerve cell (the axon). Damage of either type reduces or prevents the movement of signals through the nerve. Conditions that can lead to axillary nerve dysfunction include: Body-wide (systemic) disorders that cause nerve inflammation Deep infection Fracture of the upper arm bone (humerus) Pressure from casts or splints Improper use of crutches Shoulder dislocation In some cases, no cause can be found. Symptoms Symptoms may include any of the following: Numbness over part of the outer shoulder Pain in the shoulder region Shoulder weakness , especially when lifting the arm up and away from the body Exams and Tests Your health care provider will examine your neck, arm, and shoulder. Weakness of the shoulder can cause difficulty moving your arm. The deltoid muscle of the shoulder may show signs of muscle atrophy (loss of muscle tissue and thinning). Tests that may be used to check axillary nerve dysfunction include: EMG and nerve conduction tests will likely be normal right after the injury and should be done several weeks after the injury or symptoms start MRI or x-rays of the shoulder Treatment Depending on the cause of the nerve disorder, some people do not need treatment. The problem may get better on its own. The rate of recovery is different for everyone. It can take many months to recover. Anti-inflammatory medicines may be given if you have any of the following: Sudden symptoms Small changes in sensation or movement No history of injury to the area No signs of nerve damage These medicines reduce swelling and pressure on the nerve. They may be injected directly into the area or taken by mouth. Other medicines include: Over-the-counter pain medicines may be helpful for mild pain. Medicines to help reduce stabbing pain ( neuralgia ). Opioid pain relievers may be needed to control severe pain. If your symptoms continue or get worse, you may need surgery. If a trapped nerve is causing your symptoms, surgery to release the nerve may help you feel better. Physical therapy can help maintain muscle strength. Job changes, muscle retraining, or other forms of therapy may be recommended. Outlook (Prognosis) It may be possible to make a full recovery if the cause of the axillary nerve dysfunction can be identified and successfully treated. Possible Complications Complications may include: Deformity of the arm, shoulder contracture , or frozen shoulder Partial loss of sensation in the arm (uncommon) Partial shoulder paralysis Repeated injury to the arm When to Contact a Medical Professional Contact your provider for an appointment if you have symptoms of axillary nerve dysfunction. Early diagnosis and treatment increase the chance of controlling symptoms. Prevention Preventive measures vary, depending on the cause. Avoid putting pressure on the underarm area for long periods. Make sure casts, splints, and other appliances fit properly. When you use crutches, learn how to avoid putting pressure on the underarm.

Alternative medicine for pain relief refers to treatments that are used instead of conventional (standard) ones. Typically, they are low- or no-risk treatments. If you use an alternative treatment along with conventional medicine or therapy, it is considered complementary therapy. Information There are many forms of alternative medicine for pain relief. They include acupuncture, chiropractic, herbal medicine, massage, magnetic waves, hypnosis, biofeedback, meditation, yoga, and tai-chi. Acupuncture involves stimulating certain acupoints on the body using fine needles or other methods. How acupuncture works is not entirely clear. It is thought that acupoints lie near nerve fibers. When acupoints are stimulated, the nerve fibers signal the spinal cord and brain to release chemicals that relieve pain. Acupuncture is an effective means of relieving pain, such as for back pain and headache pain. Acupuncture may also help relieve pain due to: Cancer Carpal tunnel syndrome Fibromyalgia Childbirth (labor) Musculoskeletal injuries (such as the neck, shoulder, knee, or elbow) Osteoarthritis Rheumatoid arthritis Hypnosis is a focused state of concentration. With self-hypnosis, you repeat a positive statement over and over. Hypnosis may help relieve pain for: After surgery or labor Arthritis Cancer Fibromyalgia Irritable bowel syndrome Migraine headache Tension headache Both acupuncture and hypnosis are often offered by pain management centers in the United States. Other non-drug methods used at such centers include: Biofeedback Massage Relaxation training Physical therapy Biofeedback provides information about your body such as blood pressure, muscle tension, and others. One can find how to take control of these functions to help their symptoms. Herbal medicine involves the use of various parts of plants. Many herbal medicines can interact with prescribed medicines, or can have other undesired effects. It is important to discuss all herbal therapies with your health care provider. Some find magnetic waves helpful for healing, but these can interfere with certain medical devices and should be used only under direction of a medical provider during pregnancy.

The anti-insulin antibody test checks to see if your body has produced antibodies against insulin. Antibodies are proteins the body produces to protect itself when it detects anything foreign, such as a virus or transplanted organ. How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed. How to Prepare for the Test No special preparation is needed. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed This test may be performed if: You have or are at risk for type 1 diabetes You appear to have an allergic response to insulin Insulin no longer seems to control your diabetes You are taking insulin to control your diabetes and your blood sugar level varies a lot, with both high and low numbers that can't be explained by the food you are eating relative to the timing of your insulin injections Normal Results Normally, there are no antibodies against insulin in your blood. Antibodies can be found in the blood of many people who are taking insulin to control diabetes. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean The presence of IgG and IgM antibodies against insulin can be part of the testing that diagnoses you with type 1 diabetes. If you develop anti-insulin antibodies, insulin may not work as well, or it may not work at all. As a result, your blood sugar can be very high. Or the antibodies can also put you at risk for low blood sugar. Your provider may suggest a different form of insulin to which your body may be less likely to form antibodies. If the test shows a high level of IgE antibody against insulin, your body has developed an allergic response to the insulin. This could put you at risk for skin reactions where you inject insulin. You can also develop more severe reactions that affect your blood pressure or breathing. Medicines, such as antihistamines or low-dose injectable steroids, may help. Or you may need a treatment process called desensitization or a treatment to remove the antibodies from your blood. Risks There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks of having blood drawn are slight, but may include: Excessive bleeding Fainting or feeling lightheaded Multiple punctures to locate veins Hematoma (blood building up under the skin) Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken) Alternative Names Insulin antibodies - serum; Insulin Ab test; Insulin resistance - insulin antibodies; Diabetes - insulin antibodies Images Blood test References Atkinson MA, Mcgill DE, Dassau E, Laffel L.

Aldolase is a protein (called an enzyme) that helps break down certain sugars to produce energy. It is found in high amount in muscle and liver tissue. A test can be done to measure the amount of aldolase in your blood. How the Test is Performed A blood sample is needed. How to Prepare for the Test You may be told not to eat or drink anything for 6 to 12 hours before the test. You may be also told to avoid vigorous exercise for 12 hours before the test. Your health care provider will tell you if it is necessary to stop taking any medicines that may interfere with this test. Tell your provider about all the medicines you are taking, both prescription and nonprescription. How the Test will Feel When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away. Why the Test is Performed This test is done to diagnose or monitor muscle or liver damage. Other tests that may be ordered to check for liver damage include: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) test Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) test Other tests that may be ordered to check for muscle cell damage include: Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) test Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) test In some cases of myositis , especially dermatomyositis , aldolase level may be elevated even when CPK is normal. Normal Results Normal results range between 1.0 to 7.5 units per liter (0.02 to 0.13 microkat/L). There is a slight difference between men and women. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. What Abnormal Results Mean A higher than normal level may be due to: Damage to skeletal muscles Heart attack Liver, pancreatic, or prostate cancer Muscle disease such as dermatomyositis, muscular dystrophy , polymyositis Swelling and inflammation of the liver ( hepatitis ) Viral infection called mononucleosis Risks There is little risk involved with having your blood taken.
